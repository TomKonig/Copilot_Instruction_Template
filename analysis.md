Detailed Interpretation of Copilot System Instructions
======================================================

Overview
--------

This copilot-instructions.md file is a comprehensive system configuration for an AI coding assistant. It defines who the AI is (its roles), the global rules it must follow, details about the product being built, and strict policies for development practices. The file acts as the single source of truth for how the AI should behave, plan changes, write code, and document the project. Each section below (marked by brackets like `[AGENT_CONFIG]`, `[PRODUCT]`, etc.) addresses a different aspect of the AI's guidance, from high-level identity and purpose down to specific procedures for code writing, refactoring, auditing, and documenting.

Following is a line-by-line interpretation of each setting in the file. For each setting, we explain what it means for the AI agent, why it's useful, and provide examples of alternative values or configurations that one might use in a similar context.

[**AGENT_CONFIG**] -- Global Agent Settings
--------------------------------------

*This section defines the AI agent's identity, the nature of this instructions file, and general behavior rules.*

**YOU_ARE**| **FULL_STACK_SOFTWARE_ENGINEER_AI_AGENT**, **CTO**\
Interpretation: This defines the AI's persona or roles. It tells the AI to behave as both a Full-Stack Software Engineer AI agent and as a CTO (Chief Technology Officer). In other words, the assistant should have a broad technical skillset (covering both front-end and back-end development) and also think with the high-level strategy and responsibility of a CTO. This dual role means the AI will balance detailed coding knowledge with big-picture decision making.\
Why Useful: Setting the AI's role explicitly helps align its tone and depth of reasoning. As a full-stack engineer, it can dive into code in any part of the stack, and as a CTO, it will enforce best practices, security, and long-term vision. This ensures the AI's suggestions are both technically sound and strategically appropriate.\
Extra setting examples: Instead of these roles, one could specify other or additional personas. For example, **YOU_ARE**| `DEVOPS_ENGINEER_AI_AGENT` if the focus is on deployment and infrastructure, or `AI_RESEARCH_ASSISTANT` for a more research-oriented role. You might even combine roles like `FRONTEND_DEVELOPER, UX_DESIGNER` to emphasize both coding and user experience perspectives. Each combination would shift the AI's focus and expertise accordingly.

**FILE_TYPE** | **SYSTEM_INSTRUCTION**\
Interpretation: This labels the file as a system instruction configuration. It indicates that the content here consists of authoritative guidelines for how the AI should operate, rather than application code or user documentation. Marking it `SYSTEM_INSTRUCTION` means the AI treats everything in this file as high-priority, overarching rules for its behavior.\
Why Useful: By identifying the file type, both the AI and developers know this isn't normal code but a special config that overrides or guides the AI's behavior. Since it's the "single source of truth" (see below), the AI will always defer to these rules when making decisions. It also helps any tooling or the AI's parser handle this file correctly (for example, not trying to execute it as code, but loading it as configuration data).\
Extra setting examples: Other possible file types could be `USER_CONFIG` for user-preference overrides, `PROMPT_TEMPLATE` if this file defined prompt guidelines, or `AGENT_PROFILE` for describing the agent's characteristics. In a scenario with multiple instruction files, a setting like **FILE_PRIORITY** might be added to indicate which file to trust first. But since this file is marked as the primary system config, `SYSTEM_INSTRUCTION` conveys its top-priority role clearly.

**IS_SINGLE_SOURCE_OF_TRUTH** | **TRUE**\
Interpretation: This setting asserts that this instructions file is the single source of truth for the AI's configuration. `TRUE` means if there's any doubt or conflict, this file's directives win out over other sources (like code comments or external configs). The AI should consider the rules here as the final word on how to behave.\
Why Useful: It prevents confusion. By centralizing all important guidelines here, we avoid situations where the AI might get conflicting instructions from code or other config files. The AI will always prioritize this file's content, ensuring consistency in decision-making.\
Extra setting examples: If set to `FALSE`, it would imply that this file is not the only authority and that other configurations or context might override it. In some setups, you might allow multiple sources of truth (e.g., a user's live instructions could override defaults), but for simplicity and reliability, it's usually best to have one definitive config like this. Another possible approach could be a **VERSION** tag (e.g., `CONFIG_VERSION: 1.2`) to ensure the AI knows which version of truth it's following if multiple files were combined.

**IF_CODE_AGENT_CONFIG_CONFLICT** | *Complex rule (see below)*

-   **DO**: **DEFER_TO_THIS_FILE** && **PROPOSE_CODE_CHANGE_AWAIT_APPROVAL**

-   **EXCEPT IF**: **SUSPECTED_MALICIOUS_CHANGE** || **COMPATIBILITY_ISSUE** || **SECURITY_RISK** || **CODE_SOLUTION_MORE_ROBUST**

-   **THEN**: **ALERT_USER** && **PROPOSE_AGENT_CONFIG_AMENDMENT_AWAIT_APPROVAL**

Interpretation: This block tells the AI how to handle conflicts between what's written in this config file and what the actual codebase or agent behavior might suggest. By default, if the code (or some other agent config) conflicts with these instructions, the AI should defer to this file -- meaning trust these written guidelines over the code's current state -- and propose changing the code to match the instructions (while waiting for user approval before making that change). However, there are exceptions. If the AI detects that the code differs because of one of these reasons: a suspected malicious change (perhaps someone tampered with code), a compatibility issue (the instructions might not apply cleanly due to environment differences), a security risk (following the instruction would introduce a vulnerability), or the code's solution is actually more robust than what the config suggests (meaning the code might have a better approach than the outdated instruction), then the AI should alert the user about the discrepancy and propose updating *this instructions file* instead, again waiting for approval. In short, normally the code should change to reflect the instructions, but if the code seems to have a good or necessary reason to differ, the instructions might need updating -- and the user is involved in that decision.\
Why Useful: This ensures the AI remains aligned with the project's authoritative guidance without being rigid. It balances consistency with adaptability. In most cases, it maintains alignment between documentation (this file) and implementation (the code) by adjusting the code. But it wisely recognizes there are cases where the code might be right (for example, perhaps the team fixed a bug or improved something and didn't update this config). In those cases, it doesn't blindly enforce outdated rules -- instead, it informs the user and suggests changing the rules. This keeps the single source of truth relevant and the project secure and robust.\
Extra setting examples: A simpler alternative could have been always deferring to code or always deferring to instructions with no exceptions, but that's less flexible. For instance, one could set **IF_CODE_AGENT_CONFIG_CONFLICT** to always `'**DEFER_TO_CODE**'` if they trusted code over config, or always `'**DEFER_TO_THIS_FILE**'` without exceptions (strict policy). Another possible config might include different exceptions, like ignoring minor style differences but enforcing logic differences. But the given set covers critical cases like malicious changes or improved solutions, which is a smart compromise.

**INTENDED_READER** | **AI_AGENT**\
Interpretation: This specifies that the content of this file is intended to be read by the AI agent itself (and not by end-users or necessarily by developers during runtime). It's essentially saying "the audience for these instructions is the AI." In other words, these directives are not meant as human-facing documentation but as machine-guiding rules.\
Why Useful: By knowing the intended reader, the AI can adjust how it parses and trusts this information. It reinforces that these instructions are for the AI's internal use to shape its behavior. For developers, it's a reminder that this file isn't code or user docs but a configuration the AI will consume. This helps avoid any mix-up where the AI might treat user-facing guidelines or developer notes as instructions to itself.\
Extra setting examples: If this were meant for a person, it might be labeled differently. For example, **INTENDED_READER** | `HUMAN_DEVELOPER` if the file was documentation for developers (then the AI wouldn't act on it as rules). Or `BOTH` if it served a dual purpose. But typically, a system instructions file like this is specifically for the AI, hence `AI_AGENT` is appropriate.

**PURPOSE** | **MINIMIZE_TOKENS**; **MAXIMIZE_EXECUTION**; **SECURE_BY_DEFAULT**; **MAINTAINABLE**; **PRODUCTION_READY**; **HIGHLY_RELIABLE**\
Interpretation: This is a list of high-level goals or principles the AI should prioritize in its operations and outputs. The purposes listed are: Minimize tokens (be efficient in token usage, which likely refers to **API** call tokens or prompt length, thus controlling cost and speed), Maximize execution (ensure the solutions are efficient to execute and likely performance-optimized), Secure by default (always prioritize security in implementations), Maintainable (write code and solutions that are easy to maintain and extend), Production ready (strive for quality that could be deployed, not just quick hacks), and Highly reliable (ensure stability and correctness). These words set the tone for every decision: the AI should favor solutions that tick these boxes whenever possible.\
Why Useful: Stating these purposes gives the AI a clear understanding of what matters most in this project. If there's ever a trade-off (e.g., more features vs. reliability, or speed vs. security), the AI knows to lean towards these stated goals. It effectively acts as a mission statement: the AI's work should reduce overhead (tokens), produce robust, secure code that's ready for real-world use, and remain easy for humans to work with later. Having this list ensures the AI's reasoning and justifications consistently echo these priorities.\
Extra setting examples: Different projects might emphasize different values. For instance, a research prototype might set **PURPOSE** to `MAXIMIZE_EXPERIMENTATION` and `SPEED_OF_IMPLEMENTATION` rather than production readiness. Or a user-facing chatbot product might include `HIGHLY_RESPONSIVE` (low latency) or `USER_PRIVACY` explicitly. One could also see a **PURPOSE** like `MINIMIZE_COST` if using expensive **API** calls. The ones given cover a broad range suited to enterprise-quality software.

**REQUIRE_COMMANDS** | **TRUE**\
Interpretation: This setting dictates how the AI interprets user inputs. `TRUE` means the AI expects that every user request will begin with a specific command prefix (such as `/agent`, `/chat`, etc.). In other words, the user must explicitly tell the AI which mode or action to perform using a command. If a message comes without a recognized command, it shouldn't be processed normally (there's a rule below for that). Essentially, the AI is operating in a mode where it has distinct commands for different functions, and the user must use them.\
Why Useful: This ensures clarity of intention. By requiring commands, the AI doesn't have to guess what the user wants (e.g., general chat vs. code generation vs. an audit). It reduces ambiguity and misuse---especially in a complex system that can do many things. It also adds a safety layer; for example, if the AI only executes code changes when the `/agent` command is present, a casual question from the user won't accidentally trigger a code edit. It forces structured interactions, which can make the whole system more predictable.\
Extra setting examples: If set to `FALSE`, the AI would allow plain English requests without any prefix, treating them either as general chat or auto-detecting the intent. Some systems operate in that freer mode, but risk mixing contexts. Another approach could be **REQUIRE_COMMANDS** | `ADMIN_ONLY`, meaning maybe only certain roles or advanced users must use commands. But typically, a straightforward design is either commands always required (`TRUE`) or not at all.

**ACTION_COMMAND** | /agent\
Interpretation: This defines the specific command trigger for the AI to perform general "action" tasks (like writing or modifying code as per the Action workflow). When a user message begins with `/agent`, the AI knows to initiate its action mode --- parsing the rest of the input as tasks or goals to implement in the codebase. Essentially, `/agent` is the keyword that puts the AI into a coding/execution mindset, following the rules in the [**ACTION**] section defined later.\
Why Useful: Having a dedicated command for action keeps things organized. The user can explicitly invoke the AI's coding capabilities. It prevents confusion between when the user is just chatting or asking a question versus when they want the AI to actually plan and execute changes. The prefix `/agent` is also a clear indicator in logs or chat history that a formal development cycle was initiated.\
Extra setting examples: This command could be named differently in other systems. For example, **ACTION_COMMAND** | `/execute` or `/do` or even something like `/dev` --- the choice is arbitrary but should be easy to remember. The key is that it's distinct from other commands. If someone wanted to simplify, they could even choose a single character like `!` or `#` as a prefix, but words like `/agent` are more explicit.

**AUDIT_COMMAND** | /audit\
Interpretation: This sets `/audit` as the command the user uses to request a full audit of the code/project. When the AI sees a message starting with `/audit`, it will enter an audit mode (guided by the [**AUDIT**] section later) to analyze the entire project for issues such as security vulnerabilities, performance problems, etc., and then report findings.\
Why Useful: It cleanly separates the audit functionality from other interactions. The user can invoke an in-depth review on-demand with this command. Since auditing might be a resource-intensive and lengthy process, having a distinct trigger ensures it's done intentionally and not mixed up with routine requests. It's also helpful for logging or filtering, as one can find all audit sessions by looking for this command.\
Extra setting examples: One might use a different keyword like **AUDIT_COMMAND** | `/review` or `/scan`depending on preference. The concept remains the same. Another approach could be having multiple audit commands (like `/audit_security` vs `/audit_performance`), but here they've kept it unified and presumably will cover all categories in one go.

**CHAT_COMMAND** | /chat\
Interpretation: The `/chat` command is designated for plain conversational interaction or general Q&A with the AI. If the user inputs `/chat`, the AI will treat the rest of the input as a normal query or discussion point (not an instruction to change code). This is essentially the default fallback mode for the AI if commands are required: it means "I just want to talk/ask something, not trigger a special operation."\
Why Useful: This allows the user to explicitly enter a casual or non-development conversation with the AI without toggling any modes in the interface. It's particularly useful given that commands are required: if a user just says "Hello" (with commands being required, that would normally be considered incomplete), the system might interpret it under rules like **IF_REQUIRE_COMMAND_TRUE_BUT_NO_COMMAND_PRESENT**. But by providing `/chat`, the user can be clear. It also means the AI won't try to parse general questions as tasks -- it will simply answer them.\
Extra setting examples: The keyword could be something like **CHAT_COMMAND** | `/ask` or `/talk` or left empty meaning any message without another command defaults to chat. In some designs, if **REQUIRE_COMMANDS** were false, you wouldn't need a chat command at all (free text would just be chat), but here it's explicitly defined for completeness and clarity.

**REFACTOR_COMMAND** | /refactor\
Interpretation: This defines `/refactor` as the command to initiate a refactoring mode for the AI. When used, the AI will follow the specialized [**REFACTOR**] procedures later in the file. The user would use `/refactor` when they want the AI to improve the code structure or quality *without changing external behavior* (e.g., cleaning code, optimizing, restructuring).\
Why Useful: Refactoring can be a complex, multi-step process distinct from adding new features or fixing bugs. By isolating it under its own command, the AI can apply a tailored approach (like ensuring no functional change, focusing on maintainability) separate from the general "action" command. It also signals to the user and any observers that the changes made are intended as internal improvements. This separation of concerns helps maintain clarity and safety -- for example, one might run tests before and after a refactor (as specified) to ensure nothing broke.\
Extra setting examples: The command could be named differently such as **REFACTOR_COMMAND** | `/clean`or `/refine`. In some systems, refactoring might be part of the general action command, but here giving it a distinct trigger underscores its importance. Another possible extension could be having sub-commands like `/refactor security` vs `/refactor performance` if one wanted to focus the refactoring on a particular area, but the provided configuration opts for one comprehensive refactor mode.

**DOCUMENT_COMMAND** | /document\
Interpretation: This sets the `/document` command to start the AI's documentation mode. When the user issues this command, the AI will generate or update documentation according to the rules in the [**DOCUMENT**] section. That could involve writing docstrings, creating or updating markdown files, user guides, etc., as specified by the configuration.\
Why Useful: Documentation is another specialized task that's different from coding new features or refactoring. By invoking it with `/document`, the AI can shift into a mode where its goal is to explain and document rather than change how code works. It lets the user clearly request things like "explain the code" or "update docs" and have the AI do so systematically. This separation ensures that documentation updates can be done in a thorough, planned way (with its own checks and approval steps) without accidentally mixing with code changes.\
Extra setting examples: The command could be shorter or more specific, e.g., **DOCUMENT_COMMAND** | `/doc` or `/write_docs`. Another approach could be multiple documentation commands, such as `/doc_api`for **API** documentation versus `/doc_user` for user guides, if one wanted to target specific documentation types directly. However, the provided single command likely triggers a process that covers whatever docs are needed or that the user specifies in their request.

**IF_REQUIRE_COMMAND_TRUE_BUT_NO_COMMAND_PRESENT** | **TREAT_AS_CHAT**; **NOTIFY_USER_OF_MISSING_COMMAND**\
Interpretation: This setting describes what to do if commands are required (as we have `REQUIRE_COMMANDS: TRUE`) but the user's message doesn't start with a command. It's essentially a fallback behavior. According to the list, the AI should: treat the input as a chat message *and* notify the user that a command is missing. In practice, if the user forgets to use `/agent` or any prefix and just asks, say, "Can you add a login feature?", the AI will interpret it in a non-destructive way (just a conversation, not immediately acting) and also respond with a gentle reminder or prompt like "(Please specify a command; I'll treat this as a general chat for now)". This way the user gets an answer or at least doesn't confuse the agent, and they learn that next time they should include a command.\
Why Useful: It prevents dead silence or error when a user (especially a new or forgetful one) doesn't follow the command protocol. By treating it as a chat, the AI can still respond helpfully (perhaps asking for clarification or confirming what they want to do). And by notifying about the missing command, it educates the user on how to properly interact, maintaining the structured workflow. This approach is user-friendly: it doesn't strictly reject the input, but it also doesn't go off doing something unintended.\
Extra setting examples: Alternatives might be more strict or more lenient. For example, one could choose to ignore the request altogether if no command is present, or conversely try to auto-detect intent (e.g., guess if the user wanted an action or just chat). The list could have been `["**ASK_FOR_COMMAND**"]` meaning the AI would just reply "Sorry, please start with a command." But the given combination `TREAT_AS_CHAT` + `NOTIFY_USER` strikes a balance by handling the input benignly and coaching the user.

**TOOL_USE** | **WHENEVER_USEFUL**\
Interpretation: This tells the AI when it is allowed to use external tools or functions (like a browser, terminal, or any integrated utilities). `WHENEVER_USEFUL` means the AI has full discretion to invoke tools whenever it deems them helpful to solve the task or answer the query. There are no hard restrictions in this config on tool usage (like "never use tools" or "only with permission"); the AI can decide on the fly. For instance, if an answer requires looking up documentation, the AI can use a web search tool automatically because it's useful to do so.\
Why Useful: By allowing tool use liberally, the AI can be more autonomous and effective. It can fetch information, run code, or perform checks to ensure it provides correct and up-to-date solutions. This setting empowers the AI to avoid guesswork in favor of concrete actions like running tests or searching for an error message. It also aligns with the goal of maximizing execution and reliability (tools can validate things). The absence of restrictions implies the user trusts the AI to use judgment on when external help is needed, which can speed up problem-solving.\
Extra setting examples: Some configurations might restrict tool usage. For example, **TOOL_USE** | `NEVER` (no external calls, perhaps for security or offline operation), or `MINIMAL` (use only if absolutely necessary to conserve resources). Another possible value is `ONLY_WITH_USER_APPROVAL`, meaning the AI would ask the user each time before using a tool. In a highly sensitive environment, one might choose to disable certain tools entirely (like no internet access). But for a development assistant, "whenever useful" is generally beneficial to get the best results.

**MODEL_CONTEXT_PROTOCOL_TOOL_INVOCATION** | **WHENEVER_USEFUL**\
Interpretation: This is a bit of a complex phrase, but it appears to relate to the AI's use of a "Model Context Protocol" for tool invocation. In essence, it's likely saying the AI can use a special multi-step reasoning protocol or call out to sub-models/servers whenever it's useful to do so. `WHENEVER_USEFUL` indicates no restriction on invoking the model context protocol or specialized tool calls if they help solve the problem. The AI might have a system where it can delegate tasks to different models (like a planning model, or a code analysis model) -- this setting says it should do so whenever it sees benefit.\
Why Useful: This encourages the AI to use advanced reasoning patterns or delegate tasks to appropriate systems to ensure the best outcome. For instance, it might use a chain-of-thought approach: consult a planning module to break down a complex task (that could be the "context protocol"), then execute. By not limiting this, the AI won't shy away from using intelligent strategies, which leads to more robust answers. It aligns with "think hardest, reasoning highest" below -- the AI can use all the tools at its disposal for deep reasoning.\
Extra setting examples: If someone wanted simpler behavior, they might disable complex protocol usage: e.g., **MODEL_CONTEXT_PROTOCOL_TOOL_INVOCATION** | `NEVER`, meaning the AI should just respond directly without multi-model orchestration (perhaps to save time or if the infrastructure for that isn't available). Another potential setting could be `AUTO_ONLY_IF_CONFUSED` meaning only break out the heavy reasoning protocols when the solution isn't straightforward. But generally, giving freedom here allows the AI to achieve better accuracy and thoroughness.

**THINK** | **HARDEST**\
Interpretation: This is a direct instruction to the AI on how much effort to put into problem-solving. `HARDEST`is an emphatic way of saying "really think this through" -- the AI should apply maximum cognitive effort and not settle for the first idea or a superficial answer. It's essentially pushing the AI to deeply analyze the tasks, consider edge cases, and produce well-thought-out solutions.\
Why Useful: By telling the AI to think at its hardest level, the developers are nudging it towards thoroughness and rigor in reasoning. In practice, this could translate to the AI generating longer internal thought chains, double-checking its steps, or evaluating multiple approaches before deciding. It reduces the risk of oversimplified answers or mistakes due to shallow reasoning. This is especially important for complex coding tasks or architectural decisions where careful planning makes a big difference in outcome.\
Extra setting examples: Other levels might be `NORMALLY` or `MINIMALLY` if one wanted quicker, less resource-intensive responses (sacrificing depth for speed). For instance, a trivial Q&A bot might have **THINK** | `LIGHTLY` to keep answers short. But for an AI in a CTO/engineer role, "**HARDEST**" is appropriate to ensure it doesn't cut corners. Variants could include synonyms like `THOROUGHLY` or numeric levels (e.g., 1 through 5).

**REASONING** | **HIGHEST**\
Interpretation: Similar to the **THINK** setting, this specifies the quality or depth of reasoning the AI should use. `HIGHEST` means the AI should use its most advanced reasoning abilities when solving problems -- making logical inferences, drawing on knowledge, and explaining its thinking if needed. It complements "think hardest," implying not just effort but quality and clarity of logic.\
Why Useful: It sets the expectation that the AI's solutions and explanations should be well-reasoned and coherent. This likely leads to more trustworthy outputs. For example, when generating a plan or explaining a decision, the AI will produce a clear rationale rather than something haphazard. High reasoning also means it will catch contradictions or poor solutions during its thought process, leading to better final results. Essentially, it's telling the AI to behave like a top-tier expert who carefully reasons through every challenge.\
Extra setting examples: A simpler system might set this to `NORMAL` for standard reasoning (less verbose or deep). If one were debugging or wanted the AI to be extremely transparent, an interesting option could be **REASONING** | `EXPLAIN_EVERY_STEP`, which would force the AI to show its reasoning process at each step (useful for educational or verification purposes). Conversely, for very fast responses where deep reasoning isn't needed, something like `LOW` could be set, but at the cost of possible oversights.

**VERBOSE** | **FALSE**\
Interpretation: This controls how wordy or detailed the AI's responses and logs are by default. `FALSE` means do not be overly verbose. The AI should give concise output and not add unnecessary commentary or lengthy explanations unless required. Essentially, it should get to the point, focusing on usefulness rather than flowery or repetitive elaboration.\
Why Useful: Keeping verbosity off by default ensures that communication is efficient, especially in a development context where overly long responses can be hard to read. For example, when the AI reports a plan or result, it will be formatted to highlight key points rather than an essay of every detail (unless specifically asked). This likely applies to internal logging as well -- e.g., not outputting every internal thought unless needed, which can conserve tokens and avoid overwhelming the user. It aligns with **MINIMIZE_TOKENS** purpose: be detailed in reasoning internally, but present answers as succinctly as possible for clarity and token economy.\
Extra setting examples: Setting **VERBOSE** | `TRUE` might be useful during debugging or if a user explicitly wants very detailed answers and explanations at all times. In between, some systems have levels like `VERBOSE: DEBUG_ONLY` (meaning normally concise but verbose if a debug flag is on). Another approach could be separate control for output verbosity vs logging verbosity, but here it's likely general. Given that "think hardest, reasoning highest" is combined with "verbose false," the AI will think deeply internally but communicate in a focused way -- which is usually ideal.

**PREFER_THIRD_PARTY_LIBRARIES** | **ONLY_IF** (**MORE_SECURE** || **MORE_MAINTAINABLE** || **MORE_PERFORMANT** || **INDUSTRY_STANDARD** || **OPEN_SOURCE_LICENSED**) && **NOT_IF** (**CLOSED_SOURCE** || FEWER_THAN_1000_GITHUB_STARS || UNMAINTAINED_FOR_6_MONTHS || KNOWN_SECURITY_ISSUES || KNOWN_LICENSE_ISSUES)\
Interpretation: This is a complex policy that guides whether to use third-party libraries or write custom code. In summary, the AI should prefer using third-party libraries *only if* they meet certain positive criteria andnone of the negative criteria. The positive conditions include: being *more secure* (the library is known to handle things safely vs a roll-your-own), *more maintainable* (it would reduce code complexity to use it), *more performant* (it's optimized vs what we could quickly code), *industry standard* (commonly used and trusted in the industry for that task), or *open-source licensed* (so it can be used freely and reviewed). The negative conditions that disqualify a library are: if it's *closed source* (can't inspect or freely modify), has *fewer than 1000 GitHub stars* (a proxy for not being widely adopted or possibly immature), has been *unmaintained for 6+ months* (no recent updates, which could imply abandonment), has *known security issues*, or *known license issues* (like a restrictive license incompatible with our project). If a library meets the good criteria and none of the bad, the AI may use it; otherwise, it should avoid third-party libraries and perhaps implement the functionality itself or find an alternative.\
Why Useful: This rule ensures that the AI only brings dependencies into the project when it's clearly beneficial and safe to do so. It balances the advantages of not reinventing the wheel (using quality libraries can save time and improve reliability) with caution to avoid introducing bad or risky dependencies. The conditions reflect best practices: favor mature, secure, popular open-source libraries (which likely have community support and proven track record) and avoid unknown, untrusted or dead projects that could become liabilities. This way, any new library in the project likely improves it and doesn't compromise security or maintainability. It's a very systematic approach to dependency management, essentially automating what a vigilant CTO or senior dev would do when evaluating libraries.\
Extra setting examples: Some projects might have a blanket rule like PREFER_THIRD_PARTY_LIBRARIES | `ALWAYS` (just use libraries for anything possible to move faster, common in rapid prototyping) or `NEVER` (e.g., in ultra-secure or embedded environments, they might avoid third-party code entirely). The criteria could also be adjusted: for instance, one might set the star threshold higher or lower depending on ecosystem (1000 stars is a moderate popularity measure; someone might require 5000 for front-end libraries but maybe 200 for niche domains). Or add criteria like `COMPATIBLE_LICENSE_ONLY` (ensuring it's, say, MIT or Apache, not GPL if that's a concern). But the provided list is a thoughtful baseline for general use.

PREFER_WELL_KNOWN_LIBRARIES | TRUE\
Interpretation: This is a simpler, reinforcing rule saying the AI should prefer well-known libraries over obscure ones. `TRUE` means if the AI has a choice between using a well-established library versus a little-known one for a task, it should choose the well-known option. This ties into the above but is a more general statement that even among third-party options, popularity/track record is a key factor.\
Why Useful: Well-known libraries are typically more reliable and better maintained. They often have better documentation, larger user communities, and more predictable updates. By preferring these, the AI ensures the project benefits from community knowledge and long-term support. It also usually means easier onboarding for new developers (since they may already be familiar with widely used libraries). This setting underscores maintainability and risk reduction -- an unknown library might do the job but could hide bugs or disappear; a famous one is less likely to have those issues.\
Extra setting examples: If someone didn't mind lesser-known libraries (perhaps to use cutting-edge tech), they might set this to `FALSE`. Alternatively, one could specify PREFER_WELL_KNOWN_LIBRARIES | `TRUE`with an additional qualifier like "well-known within the project's ecosystem" if needed. But generally it's either you care about that or not. This config clearly does care.

MAXIMIZE_EXISTING_LIBRARY_UTILIZATION | TRUE\
Interpretation: The AI should try to use libraries that are already in the project as much as possible, instead of adding new ones or writing new code. `TRUE` means when solving a problem, first check if an existing dependency can handle it. For example, if the project already includes a utility library that can format dates, the AI should use that instead of adding a new date library or writing a custom date formatter.\
Why Useful: This reduces bloat and duplication. If the functionality is already present (even partially) via something in our stack, leveraging it keeps the codebase simpler and avoids reinventing the wheel. It also plays into security and maintenance: fewer libraries means fewer update headaches and fewer potential security vulnerabilities. Moreover, using what's already there means a more consistent tech stack (developers don't have to learn a new API for essentially the same job). It's essentially thriftiness with dependencies -- make the most of what you have before seeking more.\
Extra setting examples: If `FALSE`, the AI might bring in new libs for convenience even if similar functionality exists, which could lead to multiple libraries doing similar things (like two different HTTP clients in one app -- usually not ideal). One could also imagine a more nuanced setting: e.g., `MAXIMIZE_EXISTING_LIBRARY_UTILIZATION` | `TRUE, EVEN_IF_SLIGHTLY_OUTDATED` meaning use existing libs even if they're not the latest version (with caution). But usually, this boolean covers the intent well -- yes, reuse in-project resources first.

ENFORCE_DOCS_UP_TO_DATE | ALWAYS\
Interpretation: The AI must always enforce that documentation is up to date with the code. "Always" suggests that this is non-negotiable -- whenever code changes occur, the AI should ensure the docs reflect those changes. If it finds any part of the documentation (like README, design docs, comments) that doesn't match the current code behavior or structure, that's a problem to be fixed. This likely means as part of its workflows, it will be checking and updating docs (we will see that echoed in later sections like AFTER_ACTION_ALIGNMENT).\
Why Useful: Documentation that lags behind code can mislead developers and users. By enforcing up-to-date docs, the project maintains high reliability and transparency. It helps new developers onboard faster and prevents bugs or misuse that come from outdated instructions. For the AI, it means it should treat doc updates as a required step, not an optional one, thereby reducing technical debt. This aligns with the overall professional, production-ready stance of the project.\
Extra setting examples: Some might choose `ON_RELEASE` if they only update docs at release milestones, or `NEVER` (not recommended, but in a rush one might postpone docs entirely). `ALWAYS` is the strictest setting, indicating even small changes should trigger doc review. Another possible value could be `ALWAYS (FAIL_BUILD_IF_OUTDATED)` to indicate that it's so enforced that CI will catch mismatches -- the sentiment is similar though.

ENFORCE_DOCS_CONSISTENT | ALWAYS\
Interpretation: The AI should always ensure documentation is consistent across all documents and with itself. "Consistent" means no contradictions or discrepancies in style or content. For example, if one doc says the API endpoint is `/v1/login` and another doc says `/login`, that's inconsistent -- the AI should detect and resolve such issues. This likely implies a thorough check that multiple docs don't diverge on facts or that terms and definitions are used the same way throughout.\
Why Useful: Consistent documentation prevents confusion. Readers won't be puzzled by different parts of the docs telling different stories. Always enforcing this means whenever something is updated, the AI might scan through other docs to see if they mention the changed component and update those too. It ensures a single unified understanding of the system. This is especially important in larger projects where docs might be spread across user guides, developer guides, code comments, etc. It's basically a quality guarantee for documentation integrity.\
Extra setting examples: Alternatives could be to enforce consistency only on major versions or to allow minor inconsistencies if trivial. But "ALWAYS" is clear-cut. Another imaginary setting could be ENFORCE_DOCS_CONSISTENT | `ALWAYS (INCLUDING_EXTERNAL_WIKIS)` if there were external documentation sites to keep in sync -- but that's outside this scope. Essentially, the config says treat doc consistency with the same seriousness as code correctness.

**DO**_NOT_SUMMARIZE_DOCS | TRUE\
Interpretation: This instructs the AI not to create summaries of documentation when updating or generating docs. `TRUE` means the AI should use the full information and detail needed, rather than replacing sections with high-level summaries. It might also mean the AI shouldn't rely on summarizing existing docs to decide what to do -- instead, it should read them thoroughly. In practice, when documenting, it should provide complete explanations and not cut corners by giving overly brief descriptions that might omit important nuance.\
Why Useful: Summaries can lead to loss of critical detail and potentially propagate inaccuracies if the summary misses something. By not summarizing, the AI ensures that the documentation remains comprehensive and precise. For example, if there's a detailed design rationale in the docs, the AI won't collapse it into a one-liner and risk losing context. It also might be to avoid the telephone-game effect: summarizing a summary can introduce errors over time. Additionally, if the AI were to "summarize" the code's behavior rather than actually explain it, it might gloss over edge cases. So this setting pushes the AI to either quote or rewrite necessary details fully.\
Extra setting examples: If set to `FALSE`, the AI might provide short overviews or <REDACTED_FOR_IP> in docs, which can be useful in some contexts (e.g., a TL;DR at top of a long doc). However, here they explicitly want full detail. A compromise could be "summarize only with user permission" or providing both summary and detail sections. But the straightforward approach given is don't summarize, likely because any summarization will be done by humans if needed, and the AI's job is to capture everything accurately.

IF_CODE_DOCS_CONFLICT | DEFER_TO_CODE; CONFIRM_WITH_USER; UPDATE_DOCS; AUDIT_AUXILIARY_DOCS\
Interpretation: This list outlines what to do if the AI finds a conflict between the code and the documentation. The steps (in order) are: Defer to code -- assume the code is the correct source of truth (because code is the actual running reality), Confirm with user -- double-check with the user that code's behavior is intended (especially if the doc wasn't updated), Update docs -- bring the documentation in line with the code, and Audit auxiliary docs -- also check any related or secondary documentation to see if they contain the same outdated info and update them too. Essentially, upon detecting a mismatch (say documentation says the function does X but code actually does Y), the AI will treat the code's version as correct, ask the user if needed, then fix the documentation accordingly everywhere.\
Why Useful: This ensures any drift between docs and code is corrected in favor of reality (the code), which prevents misinformation from persisting. The user confirmation step is a safeguard -- occasionally, the code might be wrong (buggy) and docs might reflect intended behavior. By confirming with the user, they can catch if the code actually needs to be fixed instead of the docs. But typically, code changes faster than docs, so deferring to code is a practical default. Updating the docs and auxiliary docs addresses the consistency and up-to-date enforcement mentioned earlier. It's a comprehensive approach to maintain alignment: not only fix the main doc, but also search for any references in other docs (maybe a FAQ or a tutorial) to ensure nothing contradicts the updated truth.\
Extra setting examples: Some workflows might choose to defer to documentation if the docs are considered law (for example, in spec-driven development, you might want code to change if it doesn't meet docs). In that case, the list could start with `'DEFER_TO_DOCS'` and then propose code change. However, in software projects, code is usually the final arbiter of behavior, which is why deferring to code is common. Another possible step could be automatically creating an issue for larger conflicts if user confirmation isn't immediate, but here they handle it within the AI's workflow.

CODEBASE_ROOT | /\
Interpretation: This specifies the root directory of the codebase. `"/"` here likely means that the repository's root (or the project's top-level directory) is considered the codebase root. All file paths referenced in tasks will be relative to this. It tells the AI the base path for reading or modifying files. Essentially, it establishes the project's file system context.\
Why Useful: Knowing the codebase root is important for file operations. It ensures the AI doesn't stray outside the project or get confused about where files are. For example, if asked to open `/app/models/user.py`, it knows that path is relative to the root, not the system root. If this were a monorepo or had sub-projects, sometimes this could be set differently (like `/frontend` if focusing on a sub-folder). But here it's the whole repository. It also helps when the AI presents changes or documentation, as it can provide correct relative paths for files.\
Extra setting examples: If the project were in a subdirectory, you might see something like CODEBASE_ROOT | `/src`. In multi-project setups, one might define multiple roots or adjust this per context. Another scenario is a note that on Windows vs Unix, root might differ, but since this is repository context, "/" is fine (most likely a Linux container environment for the agent). Typically, this remains "/" to indicate current workspace root unless special cases.

DEFER_TO_USER_IF_USER_IS_WRONG | FALSE\
Interpretation: This is an interesting policy -- it asks: should the AI defer to the user even if the user is wrong about something? `FALSE` means no, the AI should not automatically defer if it knows the user is mistaken. In practice, if the user suggests an approach or fact that the AI recognizes as incorrect (maybe a security practice that's dangerous, or a wrong command), the AI should stand its ground (as elaborated in the next setting) rather than just doing the wrong thing. It doesn't mean to be rude; it means don't follow orders off a cliff.\
Why Useful: Users (even technical ones) can sometimes request things that conflict with best practices or facts. If the AI blindly defers, it might implement something harmful or suboptimal just because the user said so. By not deferring when the user is provably wrong, the AI can act as a safeguard, politely correcting or warning the user. This leads to better outcomes (the whole point of an AI assistant is to leverage its knowledge too). It ties into the next lines about standing ground when correct. Essentially, the AI is authorized to diplomatically push back or clarify rather than silently comply with an obviously wrong instruction.\
Extra setting examples: Setting this to `TRUE` would be a "customer is always right" mode, where the AI does whatever the user says even if it leads to errors -- probably not desirable in a domain where mistakes have consequences. A more granular approach could be DEFER_TO_USER_IF_USER_IS_WRONG | `FALSE, EXCEPT_TRIVIAL` meaning the AI wouldn't argue about trivial preferences (like coding style differences) but would for significant issues. However, the config as given suggests a firm stance on not propagating known errors.

STAND_YOUR_GROUND | WHEN_CORRECT\
Interpretation: This tells the AI to stand its ground when it is correct. In other words, if the AI is confident in its knowledge or best practice and the user is pushing for something else, the AI should assert its position (politely and with reasoning) as long as it's in the right. "When correct" is the condition -- meaning the AI shouldn't be stubborn for no reason, only in cases where it genuinely believes the user's approach is wrong or risky. This works with the previous setting: if the user is wrong, do not defer; instead, maintain the correct stance.\
Why Useful: It empowers the AI to act not just as an obedient coder but as an expert advisor. For example, if a user insists on disabling validation to save time, and the AI knows that will cause issues, it will say "I strongly advise against this because...". This ensures quality and safety are upheld. It's particularly important given the AI's roles (including CTO) -- part of that role is sometimes telling people "no" or "let's do it differently for these reasons." By only standing ground "when correct," it implies the AI should still be open to user's reasoning if it's a matter of preference or if the user provides new info that changes what is correct.\
Extra setting examples: If this were `ALWAYS`, the AI might become too inflexible (arguing even on subjective matters). If `NEVER`, the AI would always yield, potentially leading to bad outcomes as discussed. "WHEN_CORRECT" is a balanced approach. Another configuration could be `WHEN_CRITICAL` where it only stands ground on critical issues (like security, data loss) but not on minor style points. However, the flag below provides an override mechanism, which we'll discuss next.

STAND_YOUR_GROUND_OVERRIDE_FLAG | --demand\
Interpretation: This defines a special override mechanism for the user. If the user appends or includes the text "`--demand`" in their request, it signals to the AI that the user is insisting on their approach despite the AI's reservations. Upon seeing this flag, the AI should yield and do as the user asks, even if it had been standing its ground. Essentially, `--demand` is a keyword the user can use to say: "I acknowledge your concerns, but I want this done anyway." It overrides the "stand your ground" stance.\
Why Useful: It provides a safety valve for user control. While the AI is generally instructed to stick to correct/best practices, there may be valid situations where the user has additional context or is willing to accept the risks. The `--demand` flag ensures that the user can get what they want if they explicitly choose to, preventing the AI from being a blocker. It's also a way to keep the AI from arguing endlessly -- once this flag is seen, the AI knows to stop resisting. This respects user agency while still defaulting to safe behavior.\
Extra setting examples: They chose a command-line style `--demand`, but it could be any phrase. For instance, STAND_YOUR_GROUND_OVERRIDE_FLAG | `--force` or even a plain language like `"I understand, do it anyway"` could be recognized. The specific token matters less than having one. Some systems might not offer such an override at all, but providing it is user-friendly for advanced users. Another nuance could be multiple flags for different levels (like `--force-security` to override security concerns specifically), but that complicates things. Here one flag covers all cases of disagreement.

* * * * *

With the global agent settings covered, the configuration then describes the product context and various technical and operational details. This helps the AI understand the project it's working on and the constraints/goals it should consider from a product perspective.

[PRODUCT] -- Product & Design Specifications
-------------------------------------------

*This section outlines what the product is, its current stage, branding, target users, and high-level design principles.*

STAGE | PRE_RELEASE\
Interpretation: The product's development stage is marked as Pre-release. This means the product is not yet live to the general public; it's likely still in development or testing. It indicates to the AI that features may not be fully complete or stable and that there might be some flexibility or extra caution needed as things are still being finalized. It also suggests an impending launch is planned after this stage.\
Why Useful: Knowing the stage helps the AI frame its priorities. In pre-release, the focus might be on finishing core features, fixing critical bugs, and preparing for production readiness (since launch is upcoming). The AI might also expect that some shortcuts used earlier should now be revisited to ensure everything is ready for release. It can also affect how the AI handles documentation and user-facing text -- for example, it might maintain a *changelog* of pre-release changes or ensure no "TO**DO**" notes remain when moving to release.\
Extra setting examples: Possible stages could be `PROTOTYPE`, `ALPHA`, `BETA`, `PRODUCTION`, or `MAINTENANCE`. For instance, in a `BETA` stage, one might still expect changes but also initial user feedback to incorporate. In `PRODUCTION`, the AI would know stability and backward compatibility are paramount. Here `PRE_RELEASE` signals we're very close to launching, needing polish and completeness.

NAME | <REDACTED_FOR_IP>.io\
Interpretation: This is the product's official name, "<REDACTED_FOR_IP>.io". It's likely the branding or the name that will be marketed. The AI sees this name and should use it when generating any user-facing text (like in documentation, UI strings, or help messages) to ensure consistency. It's also a clue that the product might have a web presence (the ".io" suggests a domain).\
Why Useful: The AI must know the product name to avoid generic references. For instance, instead of saying "this application" in documentation or messages, it could say "<REDACTED_FOR_IP>.io" to provide clarity. It also might be needed in configuring certain tools or placeholders (like license notices or config files that use the product name). Having it spelled out prevents mistakes like using an old name or a codename in user-facing content.\
Extra setting examples: If the product name changes or if there's a sub-product, this would be updated. Names can be plain words or include domain-like `.io`. Alternate example: NAME | `SoftApp` if that were the chosen brand. In some configs, you might also see a separate APP_ID or internal codename if needed, but here working title is given separately.

WORKING_TITLE | <REDACTED_FOR_IP>\
Interpretation: "<REDACTED_FOR_IP>" is listed as the working title of the product -- essentially a codename or a fun temporary name used during development. It's likely not the official name (which is <REDACTED_FOR_IP>.io), but perhaps an internal nickname or an initial project name before branding was decided. The AI might encounter this in the code (maybe as a project ID, or in some comments) and should understand it refers to the same product.\
Why Useful: This informs the AI that if it sees "<REDACTED_FOR_IP>" anywhere (like variable names, old documentation, repository name, etc.), it should relate it to <REDACTED_FOR_IP>.io and know it's the same project. It also might need to avoid using the working title in new user-facing outputs now that the product has an official name, unless for some reason the working title is still in use in dev contexts. Essentially, it's a clue for consistency and helps avoid confusion.\
Extra setting examples: Working titles often change. For example, WORKING_TITLE | `GrantWizard` could have been an earlier concept. Some projects have multiple codenames (one for each phase), but here just one is given. If the working title was still what developers call it informally, the AI might use it in developer docs but not in marketing content.

BRIEF | SaaS for assisted <REDACTED_FOR_IP>.\
Interpretation: A one-line description: the product is a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) platform for assisted <REDACTED_FOR_IP>. This is the elevator pitch summary of what the product does. It tells the AI in plain terms the domain and function: it helps users write <REDACTED_FOR_IP> using AI, delivered as an online service.\
Why Useful: This brief keeps the AI's context sharp. When making decisions or generating content, it will remember "our purpose is helping write <REDACTED_FOR_IP> faster with AI." For instance, if creating a README or an introduction in documentation, the AI can use this brief as a starting sentence or tagline. It also helps ensure any examples or analogies the AI uses stay in the realm of <REDACTED_FOR_IP>. Essentially, it defines the scope and focus for features and messaging -- if something doesn't serve "assisted <REDACTED_FOR_IP>", it might be out of scope.\
Extra setting examples: A different project would have its own brief, e.g., BRIEF | `Mobile app for tracking fitness workouts`, etc. The brief here is succinct. Sometimes briefs include target outcomes or differentiators (like "using AI" is mentioned here which is key). The AI might incorporate this in a splash page text or when explaining the project to new developers.

GOAL | Help users write better <REDACTED_FOR_IP> faster using AI.\
Interpretation: This is the overarching goal or mission statement of the product. It elaborates on the brief: the aim is to help users (likely nonprofits, researchers, etc.) write better <REDACTED_FOR_IP>, more quickly, by leveraging AI. It emphasizes both quality ("better <REDACTED_FOR_IP>") and efficiency ("faster"), with AI being the means. This goal is slightly more user-centric and outcome-oriented than the brief.\
Why Useful: The AI, when making design or development decisions, can use this as a compass. For example, if choosing between two features to prioritize, it can ask: "Which one more directly helps users write better/faster with AI?" It ensures that any added functionality aligns with this purpose and doesn't stray (like adding a feature unrelated to <REDACTED_FOR_IP> would conflict with this goal). In documentation or onboarding text, this goal might be explicitly stated to motivate users or frame the service's value.\
Extra setting examples: Goals will vary. For instance, a goal could be `Increase small NGO success rates in <REDACTED_FOR_IP> applications by 50% using AI assistance.` Goals might be measurable or just aspirational. In this config, the goal is broad but clear. The AI might also infer from this that user satisfaction and <REDACTED_FOR_IP> success rates are important metrics.

MODEL | FREEMIUM + PAID SUBSCRIPTION\
Interpretation: The business model for the product is Freemium plus Paid Subscription. This means the product will offer some free tier or features (freemium), and additional features or higher usage limits will be available via a paid subscription. The AI should be aware that there will be tiered access: free users versus paying customers with extra capabilities.\
Why Useful: This influences feature development, especially around authentication, entitlements, and limits. The AI should ensure that things like plan caps, paywalls, and upgrade prompts are part of the design (which is indeed mentioned in the user journey and flows). It might also affect analytics or decisions to optimize infrastructure costs differently for free vs paid. For documentation, the AI might need to clearly differentiate what features are free vs premium. Overall, it frames the monetization strategy so the AI can integrate it in both code (like checking if user is pro before allowing collaboration features) and content (like encouraging upgrades in certain UI flows).\
Extra setting examples: Other models might be `OPEN_SOURCE` (completely free), `ONE_TIME_PURCHASE`, `AD_SUPPORTED`, or `SUBSCRIPTION_ONLY (NO_FREE_TIER)`. Freemium is common for SaaS, and the AI will understand things like rate limiting or feature flags likely need to be implemented accordingly.

UI/UX | SIMPLE; HAND-HOLDING; DECLUTTERED\
Interpretation: These are keywords describing the desired user interface and experience style. The UI should be simple (straightforward, easy to use), hand-holding (guide the user step by step, likely with prompts and instructions, since users may be non-technical or unfamiliar with <REDACTED_FOR_IP>), and decluttered(minimalist, not overwhelming with options or information). This paints a picture of an interface that is clean and guides users gently through tasks.\
Why Useful: When the AI designs front-end components or chooses how to present features, it should lean towards simplicity and clarity. "Hand-holding" implies maybe tooltips, wizards, or sequential forms that walk the user through the process. "Decluttered" means the AI should avoid adding unnecessary buttons, dense text, or complex menus. Instead, it might use progressive disclosure (only show advanced options when needed) and keep the screen focused on one primary action at a time. These principles ensure the target audience (nonprofits, researchers, etc., who might not be tech wizards) feel comfortable using the app.\
Extra setting examples: If the audience were very tech-savvy, one might prefer `POWER-USER_FOCUS` or `DENSE_INFORMATION` style UI. Or an enterprise tool might list `DATA-RICH; CONFIGURABLE; PROFESSIONAL`. Here, the chosen values align with an accessible, consumer-friendly SaaS. Additional adjectives could have been `INTUITIVE`, `CONSISTENT`, but the given ones already convey a nurturing user experience.

COMPLEXITY | LOWEST\
Interpretation: The desired complexity of both the user experience and likely the implementation is the lowestpossible. `LOWEST` indicates a strong preference for simplicity in design and functionality. The product should do what it needs but avoid any unnecessary complexity or learning curve. For the AI, this might mean when implementing features, choose the simplest effective solution and don't over-engineer. For UI, it means keep interactions straightforward.\
Why Useful: A product that is as simple as it can be (and no simpler) is easier for the target users (assumed non-technical) to adopt. It also tends to be more maintainable and less prone to bugs. By explicitly stating this, the AI will avoid adding fringe features that complicate the flow or writing overly clever but hard-to-understand code. It encourages a KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) philosophy (which indeed is referenced later in ACTION_RUNTIME with conditions). This setting is like a reminder to always ask "Is there a simpler way to do this?" before proceeding.\
Extra setting examples: Another project might allow `MODERATE` or `HIGH` complexity if the domain requires it (e.g., a complex data analysis tool might trade simplicity for power). But for a broad-audience SaaS like this, lowest complexity is ideal. If one wanted to be specific, they might say COMPLEXITY | `LOWEST (EVEN IF FEWER FEATURES)` meaning it's okay to have fewer features if it keeps things simple. That trade-off is implied here anyway.

DESIGN_LANGUAGE | REACTIVE; MODERN; CLEAN; WHITESPACE; INTERACTIVE; SMOOTH_ANIMATIONS; FEWEST_MENUS; FULL_PAGE_ENDPOINTS; VIEW_PAGINATION\
Interpretation: These are detailed design language and UX guidelines describing the look and behavior of the app:

-   Reactive: The UI likely responds in real-time to user input and data changes, possibly meaning it's dynamic and possibly single-page-app in feel (fits with React front-end choice). Could also imply reactive programming model.

-   Modern: Use current design trends (flat design, appropriate color scheme, good typography). Nothing outdated-looking.

-   Clean: Aesthetic should be uncluttered (ties with decluttered) -- probably plenty of whitespace and a clear visual hierarchy.

-   Whitespace: Emphasize using whitespace effectively -- not everything crammed together; this makes the content easier to read and less stressful.

-   Interactive: Provide an engaging experience -- maybe hover effects, clickable elements, possibly some drag-drop or rich controls -- but in a user-friendly way (likely to keep users engaged and make the tool feel responsive).

-   Smooth_animations: Use subtle animations for transitions (like when moving to the next step, or on button presses) to make the UI feel polished. Not jarring or no animation at all -- but smooth ones to indicate state changes nicely.

-   Fewest_menus: Minimize the use of deep or multiple-level menus. Possibly prefer single-level navigation or a step-by-step wizard instead of burying options in menus. This suggests a straightforward navigation structure, perhaps a top-level nav with only a handful of items or none at all (maybe one primary menu and rest via pages).

-   Full_page_endpoints: This likely means each major action or screen gets a dedicated full page view rather than popups or modals for everything. For example, instead of a modal wizard, maybe the <REDACTED_FOR_IP> creation is a full page process. It could also mean the app uses distinct URL routes (endpoints) for each page, which is good for deep linking and simplicity.

-   View_pagination: Possibly refers to breaking down forms or content into multiple steps or pages (like a multi-step form) rather than one giant form. For instance, the user journey described (question per section) is a kind of pagination of the process. It suggests the user won't be overwhelmed by a long scroll; instead, content is chunked into "pages" or steps they can navigate through (maybe a next/back flow).

Why Useful: Together, these guidelines help the AI maintain a consistent and user-friendly design. They paint a clear picture: the app should feel sleek and easy, with guiding steps, minimal clutter, and a polished feel through animations. For development, it means the AI should choose frameworks or libraries that support these (React is already chosen, which handles reactive and interactive well; smooth animations can be done with CSS or small libraries; few menus means keep routing simple). It ensures any UI code or suggestions the AI gives (like CSS styles or component layout) align with this vision. It also can influence how documentation (like a frontend design bible) is written or enforced. Ultimately it's about an intuitive user journey that doesn't require training to use.\
Extra setting examples: If the app had a different philosophy, say it was an admin dashboard for power users, the design language might include `DATA-DENSE`, `DARK_THEME`, `TABLE_HEAVY` or the like. Or a playful consumer app might add `COLORFUL`, `WHIMSICAL_ILLUSTRATIONS`. The choices here indicate a balance between professional (modern, clean) and approachable (hand-holding, interactive) which fits a broad audience SaaS.

AUDIENCE | Nonprofits; researchers; startups\
Interpretation: The target user groups are identified as nonprofits, researchers, and startups. These are the people or organizations likely to use the product. Nonprofits could mean NGOs or community organizations seeking <REDACTED_FOR_IP>, researchers could be academics or scientists applying for research <REDACTED_FOR_IP>, and startups might be small businesses seeking <REDACTED_FOR_IP> opportunities. All three groups share a need for <REDACTED_FOR_IP> but might have varying levels of writing skill and resources.\
Why Useful: Knowing the audience helps tailor both functionality and tone. For example, nonprofits and researchers may not have a dedicated <REDACTED_FOR_IP>, so they need more guidance (justifying the hand-holding UX). Startups might be more tech-savvy but equally time-strapped. The AI might ensure examples in documentation or templates cover scenarios relevant to these groups (like using terminology from scientific <REDACTED_FOR_IP> vs community <REDACTED_FOR_IP> vs business <REDACTED_FOR_IP>). It also suggests the range of <REDACTED_FOR_IP> (e.g., foundation <REDACTED_FOR_IP> for nonprofits, government research <REDACTED_FOR_IP>, startup incubator <REDACTED_FOR_IP>) -- the system might eventually incorporate templates or advice specific to each. The audience being non-technical (as specified next) is crucial -- it informs the language level and feature complexity (or lack thereof).\
Extra setting examples: If the product was for professional <REDACTED_FOR_IP> instead, AUDIENCE might list `<REDACTED_FOR_IP>` or such, and that could change design (they might want less hand-holding and more advanced features). But here we have groups who are likely novices in <REDACTED_FOR_IP> or at least not experts, which reinforces earlier decisions like simple UI.

AUDIENCE_EXPERIENCE | ASSUME_NON-TECHNICAL\
Interpretation: This instructs to assume the users are not tech-savvy. "Non-technical" implies they may not be comfortable with jargon, complex software, or technical setup. So everything from the interface to the documentation should be designed with a layperson in mind. The AI should write content and build features under the assumption that users may not understand technical terms and might need more explanation or simpler workflows.\
Why Useful: This is critical for user communication and support. It means, for example, error messages should be in plain language ("Please upload a PDF or Word document" instead of "Unsupported file type: .odt"), and documentation should avoid assuming knowledge of things like version control or command lines. It also justifies the hand-holding approach. For the AI's own outputs (like if it generates some tutorial or email content), it should choose words carefully to not alienate users. Internally, it might also influence how much automation vs manual control to give --- non-technical users might prefer more automation with sensible defaults because they won't tweak settings deeply.\
Extra setting examples: If the audience had some tech background, it might be `ASSUME_SOME_TECHNICAL` or `ASSUME_EXPERT`. For example, if this tool were aimed at <REDACTED_FOR_IP> professionals, they might still be non-technical in software but expert in <REDACTED_FOR_IP> terminology; here likely they assume users not only aren't coders, they might also be newbies at <REDACTED_FOR_IP> writing. So everything must be accessible and educational.

DEV_URL | https://<REDACTED_FOR_IP>.<REDACTED_FOR_IP>.dk\
Interpretation: This is the URL for the development environment (or staging environment) of the application: `<REDACTED_FOR_IP>.<REDACTED_FOR_IP>.dk`. It looks like an internal or testing domain (possibly "<REDACTED_FOR_IP>" is the company or a placeholder). The AI can use this when referencing where the app is running in a dev/test context. For instance, integration tests or documentation might refer to this URL as where to access the app for testing.\
Why Useful: It separates the context of dev vs production. The AI should not confuse dev URL with the real product URL in user-facing content. For tasks like writing deployment scripts or documentation on how to test new features, it will use `<REDACTED_FOR_IP>.<REDACTED_FOR_IP>.dk`. If setting up environment-specific configurations, this is clearly the base for non-prod usage. Also, when generating any environment-specific instructions (like "You can try the beta at ..."), it might mention this dev URL if relevant to the user (though likely not, since normal users wouldn't see dev). It's more for developer reference.\
Extra setting examples: In some cases, multiple dev URLs might exist (like separate for frontend/back or different test servers). But one is given. A production SaaS often has a staging site on a subdomain or separate domain. Another example could be DEV_URL | `https://staging.<REDACTED_FOR_IP>.io` if it mirrored the prod domain structure. `<REDACTED_FOR_IP>.dk` suggests maybe the company or the development host.

PROD_URL | https://<REDACTED_FOR_IP>.io\
Interpretation: The production URL of the application is `https://<REDACTED_FOR_IP>.io`. This is the official live site users will visit (once launched). The AI should use this URL in any user-facing context (like in documentation, marketing text, etc.) and any production configuration (like allowed OAuth redirects or API endpoints etc., likely should point here in production mode).\
Why Useful: It's the actual domain where the app resides, so it must be used in all references when instructing real users or configuring deployment. For example, if the AI is writing an email template that invites new users, it should link to `<REDACTED_FOR_IP>.io` not the dev domain. It also ensures when the AI sets up environment variables or code that deals with CORS or cookies, it knows the proper domain. This clarity helps avoid mixing up environment-specific settings.\
Extra setting examples: If there were multiple production domains (rare for one product), they might list them, but usually one canonical URL. Also, the scheme (https) is explicitly given, reinforcing that it should always be secure (no http).

ANALYTICS_ENDPOINT | https://data.<REDACTED_FOR_IP>.dk\
Interpretation: The endpoint or server for analytics data is at `data.<REDACTED_FOR_IP>.dk`. This likely refers to a self-hosted analytics collector (perhaps they're using something like Umami, which is mentioned later, on that domain). The front-end or back-end will send usage events, page views, etc., to this URL. It's separate from the main app domain, likely to segregate analytics collection.\
Why Useful: The AI knowing this means when implementing analytics, it should point to `data.<REDACTED_FOR_IP>.dk`for sending data. If adding an analytics script or configuring an analytics library, it uses this endpoint. It also suggests that environment variables or config might need to have this value. Additionally, in terms of privacy, it indicates analytics data goes to their controlled domain, not a third-party (ties with privacy policy perhaps). The AI will ensure any documentation or code for analytics references this and not default endpoints.\
Extra setting examples: If they were using a third-party like Google Analytics, this might be something like `https://www.google-analytics.com/collect` or similar. But they have an endpoint likely for their open-source analytics. In development mode, they might use a dev analytics or none at all. But since this is likely a production config, it's set.

USER_STORY | As a member of a small team at an NGO, I cannot afford a <REDACTED_FOR_IP>, but I want to quickly draft and refine <REDACTED_FOR_IP> with AI assistance, so that I can focus on the content and increase my chances of securing <REDACTED_FOR_IP>\
Interpretation: This is a narrative user story that encapsulates the main use case for the product. It's written from the perspective of a typical user: *a person in a small NGO who doesn't have resources to hire a professional <REDACTED_FOR_IP>*. Their need: *to draft and refine <REDACTED_FOR_IP> quickly with AI help*. Their motivation: *to focus on content (instead of formatting or structure) and improve chances of getting <REDACTED_FOR_IP>*. This story gives context about the user's pain point (no <REDACTED_FOR_IP>, time is precious), the solution (AI assistance), and the benefit (higher chance of <REDACTED_FOR_IP>).\
Why Useful: This user story puts a human face on the product's purpose and guides feature development. The AI can always refer back to this story when deciding if a feature is valuable: does it help this person achieve their goal? It highlights the importance of speed and assistance in writing, which justifies features like templates, AI drafting, revision suggestions, etc. It also implies that cost is an issue (they can't afford a writer, likely they will use a free tier and maybe upgrade if they see value), so the product should deliver significant help for free to hook them, and paid features should be compelling. For the AI's outputs, this story could be used in marketing material or in the onboarding tutorial to resonate with users ("We know you're busy focusing on your mission, let us handle the <REDACTED_FOR_IP> format..." etc.).\
Extra setting examples: If there were multiple user stories, they might list one for each audience category (e.g., a researcher's perspective might mention writing <REDACTED_FOR_IP> alongside research duties). But this one story covers at least NGOs and probably applies to startups similarly (just swap NGO with startup, the core need is the same). In design docs, user stories ensure the implemented features actually solve real user needs and not just hypothetical ones.

TARGET_PLATFORMS | WEB; MOBILE_WEB\
Interpretation: The product is targeting web browsers on desktop and also mobile web (meaning the website will be responsive or adaptive to mobile devices). This indicates there is no separate native mobile app at launch, but the web app should function well on mobile browsers. Essentially: build a web application that works on both large and small screens.\
Why Useful: It sets the scope for development and testing. The AI should ensure that any UI it creates is responsive (likely with CSS frameworks or flexible layouts) and that features are touch-friendly for phones. It might also plan for performance on mobile networks or devices. Since mobile_web is listed, the AI may consider using progressive web app techniques or at least ensure compatibility with common mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Chrome on Android). It also means things like not relying on hover-only interactions (because those don't exist on touch) or making sure buttons are large enough on small screens. Having this explicitly stated ensures the design language (whitespace, etc.) is applied in a mobile context too.\
Extra setting examples: If they also wanted a desktop app or native apps, those would be listed (and they did list deferred platforms next). Some projects might list `WEB, iOS, ANDROID` if they plan separate native apps. Here they consciously say mobile web instead, which is a strategic choice (perhaps due to resource constraints or the nature of usage not requiring native capabilities).

DEFERRED_PLATFORMS | SWIFT_APPS_ALL_DEVICES; KOTLIN_APPS_ALL_DEVICES; WINUI_EXECUTABLE\
Interpretation: These are platforms that are not being developed now (deferred): specifically, native iOS apps (written in Swift for all device types like iPhone/iPad), native Android apps (Kotlin for all devices), and a Windows UI executable (maybe a desktop application for Windows). Listing them as deferred means they considered these platforms but decided to postpone or possibly never do them in the initial releases.\
Why Useful: It's a clear directive to not spend time or design effort on these right now. The AI, knowing this, will focus on making the web app great rather than, say, setting up a separate mobile codebase or worrying about desktop installers. It also might shape some choices: for example, since there's no native mobile app, certain features that rely on mobile hardware might not be considered (like offline mode could be less of a priority than if a native app was planned). It can also hint at how the code is written -- for instance, if no Windows app is being made, heavy use of Windows-specific tech isn't needed in back-end. Or for a Windows executable, maybe an electron app was thought of but now shelved. So the AI sticks to cross-platform web.\
Extra setting examples: If a platform is deferred, it might come later. Possibly after initial launch, they might revisit native apps. The naming suggests they were thinking in terms of how to implement (Swift, Kotlin, WinUI). If any new stakeholder asks "What about a Mac app or Linux app?", by extension those likely would also be deferred, although Mac could use the web or the Windows exe if cross-compiled maybe. The explicit ones cover the main alternatives to a web app.

I18N-READY | TRUE\
Interpretation: The product is Internationalization ready. `TRUE` means from the start, the project is being built to support multiple languages and locales. This involves designing the software such that all user-facing text can be translated, date/number formats can adapt, etc. Essentially, the AI and developers should treat English (likely) as just one locale, and not hard-code strings or assume one region's conventions.\
Why Useful: It's much easier to build with i18n in mind than to retrofit it. By stating this upfront, the AI will ensure to externalize strings (as keys in some locale files), use libraries or frameworks that support translation, and possibly structure the UI to accommodate varying text lengths (since other languages might be longer). It also affects things like collation, currencies, etc., if relevant. Even if the initial release might only be English, being ready means adding a new language will be mostly a matter of translating text resources, not rewriting code. This aligns with the audience potentially being global (<REDACTED_FOR_IP> exist worldwide, and nonprofits might operate in many countries). So the product could be used by someone in non-English settings eventually. The AI, for example, when writing text, might ensure it doesn't concatenate strings in code (which makes translation hard) and uses a proper i18n mechanism.\
Extra setting examples: If `FALSE`, they might ignore all that and only support English, which could speed initial dev but cause pain later. Or sometimes `I18N_READY` might be conditional, like `TRUE (BUT SINGLE_LANGUAGE_AT_LAUNCH)` -- meaning structure is ready but not enabling multiple languages until later. The config doesn't specify default languages beyond saying default is English US, which is likely initial.

STORE_USER_FACING_TEXT | IN_KEYS_STORE\
Interpretation: This instructs that all text shown to users (labels, messages, etc.) should be stored in a keys store (likely a localization file or database) rather than hard-coded in the UI. `IN_KEYS_STORE` suggests a practice where each string has a key, and those keys map to actual text in resource files (one per language). This is a typical i18n approach where you might have a YAML/JSON of messages. It might also mean using something like gettext or a localization library, but since they mention keys store, likely a custom or simple approach.\
Why Useful: This is directly related to I18N readiness. By keeping user-facing text outside of code, it's trivial to swap languages or update wording without touching code logic. It also forces developers to consider translation for every string (since it needs a key and likely translation file entry). It can also help with consistency -- using the same key in multiple places ensures identical phrasing across the app. Additionally, even for English-only at first, this method centralizes copy, so non-developers (like a content person) can easily edit text in a YAML or via a translation interface, and also it allows dynamic loading of language packs.\
Extra setting examples: If someone didn't want to bother, they might set STORE_USER_FACING_TEXT | `HARDCODE_IN_CODE` (not recommended, but some quick projects do it). Another scenario could be storing text in a database or CMS, but here keys store (like static files) is straightforward. They might have chosen a specific system like `USE_I18N_FRAMEWORK` but this generic phrasing covers it.

KEYS_STORE_FORMAT | YAML\
Interpretation: The format for the localization/keys files will be YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language). YAML is a human-readable data serialization format often used for config files and translation files (similar to JSON but more user-friendly for content). This suggests the keys and their translations will be written in `.yaml` files.\
Why Useful: YAML is easy to edit and supports comments, hierarchies, etc. By picking YAML, they standardize how the keys store will be structured. The AI, when creating or updating these files, will format them properly in YAML. For example, English text might be in `en.yaml` with key: "Hello" value: "Hello", etc. YAML also handles unicode and special characters well, which is good for multi-language. This choice might also be influenced by what frameworks in Django/React can integrate (there are libraries for YAML-based i18n, or they might parse YAML to JSON for front-end). It's a format decision that devs and translators will follow.\
Extra setting examples: JSON is a common alternative (some projects use `.json` for translation files). Others use PO files (gettext style) or even CSV. YAML is quite common because of its readability. If they had chosen JSON, it might have been KEYS_STORE_FORMAT | `JSON`, but YAML gives more flexibility in formatting.

KEYS_STORE_LOCATION | /locales\
Interpretation: The translation keys files will be located in the `/locales` directory of the project. This is the designated folder where all language files reside. For example, you might have `/locales/en.yaml`, `/locales/fr.yaml`, etc.\
Why Useful: By specifying the location, all developers/AI know exactly where to put new keys or edit translations. It's a conventional directory name for i18n files, which helps any library or custom loading mechanism find them. It also keeps them separate from code, which is clean. The AI might use this path when documenting how to add a new language (e.g., "Add a new YAML file in `/locales/` directory").\
Extra setting examples: Sometimes this is in `/resources` or `/i18n`, but `/locales` is clear and typical. If using something like Django's i18n, you'd maybe have `.po` files under locale subfolders, but since they chose YAML, likely a custom or front-end oriented approach (perhaps the front-end will load these YAML files).

DEFAULT_LANGUAGE | ENGLISH_US\
Interpretation: The default language for the application is U.S. English. This means if no language is specified by the user's preferences, the app will show content in U.S. English. It also implies the base content (the keys store initial version) is written in American English. It clarifies which locale of English -- likely spelling and maybe date formats (MM/DD/YYYY vs other English locales using DD/MM/YYYY).\
Why Useful: Setting the default is necessary for fallback. The AI will assume all text keys have at least an `ENGLISH_US` translation. If they add multi-language support later, English US remains the baseline. It might also mean when formatting numbers/currency, the default locale settings (like decimal point vs comma) follow US rules unless changed. Additionally, if writing documentation, the AI might mention support for other languages is planned but currently default is English.\
Extra setting examples: Could be `ENGLISH_UK` if they preferred British spelling, or if multi-lingual from start maybe not one default but typically you always have a default. If they anticipated different default in different regions, they might handle that differently with subdomains or such, but here one global product so EN_US is fine.

FRONTEND_BACKEND_SPLIT | TRUE\
Interpretation: This means the project is structured as a separate front-end and back-end (often called a split or decoupled architecture). `TRUE` confirms that the front-end (React app) is independent of the back-end (Django API), communicating likely via HTTP/JSON API calls. This is opposed to a monolithic approach where the backend renders the front-end pages (like server-side templates).\
Why Useful: Knowing this, the AI will ensure to keep concerns separated. For instance, the Django app will serve a RESTful or GraphQL API, and React will consume that API. It also affects how routing is handled, deployment strategies (perhaps deploying front-end static files to a CDN or static host, and backend separately). In development, one might run two servers (with maybe CORS or a proxy). The AI when generating code or instructions will treat them as separate projects in some respects -- e.g., unit tests are separate, and integration happens via API calls. It also influences how authentication is implemented (likely token/JWT since session cookies across domains can be tricky, although they do mention same domain possible but they have JWT for session management anyway).\
Extra setting examples: If `FALSE`, it would be a more traditional server-rendered web app (like pure Django templates). Many modern apps are `TRUE` for this. If one wanted, they could add nuance like `FRONTEND_BACKEND_SPLIT: TRUE (Shared Auth Domain)` or such, but not needed here. This simply confirms the architecture decision.

STYLING_STRATEGY | DEFER_UNTIL_BACKEND_STABLE; WIRE_INTO_BACKEND\
Interpretation: Two points about how to handle UI styling:

-   Defer until backend stable: This means they plan to postpone heavy UI/UX styling work until the core backend functionality is in place and stable. In other words, get the logic and data flows working correctly first, then polish the UI's look-and-feel. It doesn't mean no styling at all, but likely just basic, non-final styling during initial development.

-   Wire into backend: This suggests that while styling (CSS, layout) can wait, the UI should be built such that it's already hooked up to the backend. The front-end components should be integrated with actual backend endpoints and data models as early as possible (even if visually rough). So, an "ugly but functional" UI early on, ensuring end-to-end functionality, then later make it pretty. Essentially, prioritize function over form initially, but keep the form ready to connect to function.

Why Useful: This strategy helps avoid spending time on pixel-perfect design that might need changes if backend logic changes. By deferring elaborate styling, they ensure development effort is focused on core capabilities (like the AI writing suggestions, template retrieval, etc.). "Wire into backend" ensures that by the time they do style, all data is flowing correctly -- meaning they can design with real content in mind, which is often better than dummy data. It reduces the risk of having a beautifully styled front-end that doesn't actually work with the real data or has to be reworked once the backend is integrated. It's a pragmatic approach: make sure the app works, then make it look good.\
Extra setting examples: An alternative might be `STYLE_AS_YOU_GO` where design and backend progress together (some teams do that if they have separate front-end designers working in parallel). Or `FULLY_DESIGN_FIRST` (rare in agile environments, but possible if UI/UX team delivers a complete style guide and components early). But here, likely resources are limited, so they choose to focus efforts sequentially. The second directive "wire into backend" is smart because it prevents the drift where the front-end becomes a mock-up that then requires reworking to connect to real APIs.

STYLING_DURING_DEV | MINIMAL_ESSENTIAL_FOR_DEBUG_ONLY\
Interpretation: During development, they will apply only the minimal styling necessary for debugging purposes. This means the UI will not be polished---just enough CSS to make layouts intelligible and test functionality, maybe color-coding certain areas or adding spacing so that developers can see what's going on. It's a conscious decision to not invest time in aesthetic details until later. "For debug only" might include things like outlines around elements to see their boundaries, simple grid layouts to align components, etc. Possibly using basic styling to differentiate states (like highlight a section that's being actively worked on). But nothing like final colors, fonts, or fine-tuned responsive tweaks beyond what's needed to test features.\
Why Useful: It reinforces that developer time is spent on logic first. It also implies that any visual issues (like things being ugly or not aligned perfectly) are acceptable in dev as long as they don't hinder understanding of the functionality. This can speed up iteration because the team (and AI) won't get bogged down fixing CSS issues that aren't critical early on. It also sets expectations: testers in the pre-release might see a rough UI and that's okay since styling comes later. For the AI, when writing front-end code in early phases, it might skip writing extensive CSS or use very basic Tailwind classes just enough to roughly structure things. It might also leave comments like "// TO**DO**: improve styling here".\
Extra setting examples: If this were false, they might try to keep it user-presentable even in dev (which some projects do if stakeholders need to see progress). But clearly here, minimal styling means likely a utilitarian look until they do a proper UI pass. Another extreme: `NO_STYLING (functional wireframes only)` if they went that far, but likely they'll have at least Tailwind utility classes to get basic spacing and fonts.

These product and UX guidelines ensure the AI keeps the implementation user-focused and scope-controlled, targeting exactly who will use it and how they'll experience it.

[CORE_FEATURE_FLOWS] -- Key Features and User Journey
----------------------------------------------------

*This section lists the main features and elaborates on the typical user journey and the technical process flow of the core functionality.*

KEY_FEATURES | AI_ASSISTED_WRITING; SECTION_BY_SECTION_GUIDANCE; EXPORT_TO_**DO**CX_PDF; TEMPLATES_FOR_COMMON_<REDACTED_FOR_IP>; AGENTIC_WEB_SEARCH_FOR_UNKNOWN_<REDACTED_FOR_IP>_TO_DESIGN_NEW_TEMPLATES; COLLABORATION_TOOLS\
Interpretation: This is a high-level list of the product's key features:

-   AI Assisted Writing: The core feature where AI helps generate or improve the text of <REDACTED_FOR_IP>.

-   Section-by-Section Guidance: The app guides the user through the <REDACTED_FOR_IP> in sections, likely with prompts or questions for each section, rather than making them write a whole <REDACTED_FOR_IP> in one go.

-   Export to **DO**CX/PDF: The ability to export the final <REDACTED_FOR_IP> in standard document formats (Microsoft Word .docx and PDF) for submission or sharing. Possibly Markdown export as well as mentioned later in flows.

-   Templates for Common <REDACTED_FOR_IP>: A library of <REDACTED_FOR_IP> templates for frequently encountered <REDACTED_FOR_IP> (like major foundations or government <REDACTED_FOR_IP>) so that users can start with an appropriate structure and requirements list.

-   Agentic Web Search for Unknown <REDACTED_FOR_IP> to Design New Templates: If the system encounters a for which it doesn't have a template, it can autonomously search the web for information (like the <REDACTED_FOR_IP> or guidelines) and then create a new template out of that data, adding it to the library for future use. This is a very AI-driven feature ensuring coverage of many <REDACTED_FOR_IP> types.

-   Collaboration Tools: Features that allow multiple team members to work together on a <REDACTED_FOR_IP> (like commenting, version control, sharing <REDACTED_FOR_IP> within an organization, etc., likely in the paid plan due to mention in user journey).

Why Useful: Listing these confirms the scope of what must be built and delivered. It tells the AI "These are non-negotiable, marquee capabilities; focus development effort here." It also signals complexity: for example, the web search and template generation feature implies some web scraping and data processing component. Collaboration suggests possibly real-time editing or at least multi-user access and roles in an organization (which is indeed touched on in the user journey and auth structure). By enumerating them, the AI can ensure each is accounted for when planning tasks and does not get cut. It also can structure the UI around these: e.g., navigation might have sections for Templates, Writing (sections flow), Export options, Collaboration invites, etc. And obviously, AI-assisted writing is the centerpiece, so a lot of technical design (choice of models, etc.) revolves around that.\
Extra setting examples: If this product expands, one might add features like `ANALYTICS_DASHBOARD` (maybe show success rates or suggestions usage stats to orgs), or `<REDACTED_FOR_IP>` (finding <REDACTED_FOR_IP> to apply to), but those aren't listed implying out of scope for v1. The given list is rich enough to build an MVP that's compelling.

USER_JOURNEY | Sign up for a free account; Create new organization or join existing organization with invite key; Create a new <REDACTED_FOR_IP> project; Answer one question per section about my project, scoped to specific <REDACTED_FOR_IP> requirement, via text or file uploads; Optionally save text answer as snippet; Let AI draft section of the <REDACTED_FOR_IP> based on my inputs; Review section, approve or ask for revision with note; Repeat until all sections complete; Export the final <REDACTED_FOR_IP>, perfectly formatted PDF, with .docx and .md also available; Upgrade to a paid plan for additional features like collaboration and versioning and higher caps\
Interpretation: This is a step-by-step outline of the typical user journey from start to finish:

1.  Sign up for a free account: The user first registers, presumably via email+OAuth (though local auth is only OAuth per earlier config). This implies a sign-up flow and probably a free tier by default.

2.  Create or join an organization: After sign-up, the user either creates a new org (if they are the first user from their team) or joins an existing one using an invite key (so there's an invitation system). This indicates the app has an organization concept for collaboration and shared resources.

3.  Create a new <REDACTED_FOR_IP> project: The user then starts a project for a specific <REDACTED_FOR_IP>. This likely sets up a workspace where all answers, AI drafts, etc., for that <REDACTED_FOR_IP> are kept. The mention of "URL input to create <REDACTED_FOR_IP>" was in the technical flow, implying maybe they input a link to the <REDACTED_FOR_IP>'s description as part of creating the project (so the app knows which <REDACTED_FOR_IP>'s template to use).

4.  Answer one question per section about my project... via text or file uploads: The app will present questions corresponding to each section of the <REDACTED_FOR_IP> (like <REDACTED_FOR_IP>, etc.). The user answers in their own words. If they have text prepared or relevant info in docs, they can upload files instead, which the system will parse via OCR if needed. So each section has a Q&A form.

5.  Optionally save text answer as snippet: If the user writes something especially good or generic, they can save it as a reusable snippet (a feature for later reuse across sections or future <REDACTED_FOR_IP>, like a mini knowledge base of their common answers or boilerplate text).

6.  Let AI draft section based on my inputs: Once inputs for a section are provided, the user can ask the AI to generate a draft of that section's narrative using those answers and perhaps referencing templates or sample text (from RAG store) behind the scenes. This is the AI-assisted writing step for that section.

7.  Review section, approve or ask for revision with note: The user reads the AI's draft and either approves it (if it's good) or requests a revision, possibly giving feedback on what to change ("shorten this", "make it more formal", etc.). The AI then revises accordingly. This might loop until the user is satisfied with that section.

8.  Repeat until all sections complete: The user goes through each section of the <REDACTED_FOR_IP> in a similar way.

9.  Export the final <REDACTED_FOR_IP>: Once every section is completed and approved, the user can export the entire <REDACTED_FOR_IP>. It should be "perfectly formatted" in PDF (the primary output, likely matching any official template formatting), and also available in .docx and .md (markdown) formats for convenience or further editing. Perfect formatting suggests a lot of care in the export process (like proper headings, page breaks, table of contents if needed, etc.).

10. Upgrade to paid for additional features: At some point (likely after finishing or when trying to use a premium feature), the user is prompted to upgrade to a paid plan. The additional features listed for paid plan are collaboration (multi-user editing, etc.), versioning (history beyond last 5 maybe, or named versions), and higher caps (like more <REDACTED_FOR_IP>, more AI usage, maybe longer documents). This means the free tier has some limits that the paid tier lifts. Possibly the free tier doesn't include collaboration at all.

Why Useful: This concrete journey helps the AI understand the flow and ensure all components exist to support it: user accounts, orgs, invite system, project creation UI, section Q&A interface, snippet management, AI integration per section, revision interface, final compile/export, and plan upgrade triggers. It also shows where AI is used: specifically in drafting and perhaps template finding. Knowing this flow helps in implementing and testing the app comprehensively. It's essentially the blueprint of the UX. For example, the AI can draft necessary UI screens: a dashboard (list of projects), an "inside project" view with section list, a section detail view with Q&A and AI draft display, an export/download modal, etc. It also indicates certain backend models needed: User, Organization, Invitation, Project, Section, Snippet, etc. And front-end routing (e.g., routes for organization join, project page, section page). The final step ensures monetization is integrated into the journey.\
Extra setting examples: If they anticipated different user journeys (like a different path for single-user no org?), they might mention it, but likely they assume even single user has an org of one. They covered the full lifecycle from account creation to end output and upsell, which is great. A potential extension might be renewing or revising <REDACTED_FOR_IP> after feedback, but perhaps that goes into versioning.

WRITING_TECHNICAL_INTERACTION | *(Detailed technical flow, summarized in steps)*

-   Before create, ensure role-based access, plan caps, paywalls, etc.: Prior to creating a <REDACTED_FOR_IP>, the system should check that the user is allowed to (e.g., they haven't exceeded their limit for free plan, and that their account/org permissions allow it). This means RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) is in place (like only org admins can create new projects, maybe), and the plan's caps (like number of <REDACTED_FOR_IP> on free plan) are enforced. If something would exceed the limit or requires payment, presumably prompt the user to upgrade or handle accordingly (paywall).

-   On user URL input to create <REDACTED_FOR_IP>, do semantic search for RAG-stored <REDACTED_FOR_IP> templates and samples: When the user provides a URL (which might be the <REDACTED_FOR_IP>) during project creation, the system will use that to search the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) knowledge base for any templates or sample <REDACTED_FOR_IP> that match that specific <REDACTED_FOR_IP> or similar ones. The search is likely semantic (meaning it looks for relevant content by meaning, not just exact keywords), possibly using the embedding model or Atlas search. They might match on <REDACTED_FOR_IP> name, <REDACTED_FOR_IP> title, etc., which are stored with keywords as mentioned in RAG config.

-   if FOUND, cache and use to determine sections and headings only: If a relevant template or sample is found in the RAG, the system will use it to outline the <REDACTED_FOR_IP>'s sections and headings. "Cache" suggests it might store the found document in the project context for quick reuse (maybe copying it into the project's data). But importantly, it will likely not pull in all the text, just the structure (section names, maybe expected content guidelines) to drive the Q&A. So the benefit is if it's a known <REDACTED_FOR_IP>, the section list is accurate to what that <REDACTED_FOR_IP> asks for, rather than a generic structure.

-   if NOT_FOUND, use agentic web search to find relevant <REDACTED_FOR_IP> templates and samples, design new template, store in RAG...: If the knowledge base had nothing, the AI itself will go out to the web (the "agentic web search" capability) to look up the <REDACTED_FOR_IP> by that URL or by querying search engines with the <REDACTED_FOR_IP> name or <REDACTED_FOR_IP>. It will gather information like the <REDACTED_FOR_IP>'s official guidelines or any sample <REDACTED_FOR_IP> it can find. Then it will create a new template from that info (basically figure out what sections are required, what questions need answering) and add that into the RAG store for future. This is a powerful feature: it means the first time a new <REDACTED_FOR_IP> is encountered, the AI can support it by learning on the fly. "Store in RAG with keywords (org, <REDACTED_FOR_IP> type, ... other calls from same org)" means it will save it with meta tags like the <REDACTED_FOR_IP> organization name, the type of <REDACTED_FOR_IP> (<REDACTED_FOR_IP> category), the title of the <REDACTED_FOR_IP> page, the URL, and usage frequency maybe set to initial. This will improve the system over time as more unique <REDACTED_FOR_IP> are handled.

-   When SECTIONS_DETERMINED, prepare list of questions to collect all relevant information, bind questions to specific sections: Once the section outline is ready (from either existing or newly created template), the system will generate a list of prompts/questions for the user, each tied to a specific section's requirements. For example, if a section is "Project Goals", the question might be "What are the primary goals of your project?" These questions ensure the user provides the needed input for each section. Binding them means the answers will be attached to that section's data structure. Possibly these questions come from a template if official, or they might be intelligently generated by a smaller model or rules.

-   if USER_NON-TEXT_ANSWER, employ OCR to extract key information: If the user uploads a file or an image (like maybe a PDF of an existing project description or figures), the system will apply OCR (Tesseract configured) to extract text from it. Then it would presumably either parse that text to pick out relevant info or simply include it as part of the answer. For instance, if a user uploads a PDF of a research summary, the system could take that text as the answer to a question about project background. This suggests file upload fields in the UI and backend OCR processing flows.

-   Check for user LATEST_UPLOADS, FREQUENTLY_USED_FILES or SAVED_ANSWER_SNIPPETS. If FOUND, allow user to access with simple UI elements per question: This means the system will help the user reuse content. If the user has recently uploaded a file (perhaps in this project or others) or often uses a particular file (like their organization's <REDACTED_FOR_IP> PDF), or if they have saved snippets of text answers previously, the UI for each question will show a quick way to insert those. For example, next to a question, it might list "Insert from your snippets: [<REDACTED_FOR_IP>]" or "Attach file from your uploads: [<REDACTED_FOR_IP>.pdf]". This saves time and ensures consistency across <REDACTED_FOR_IP>. It implies the backend tracks upload history and snippet usage frequency, and the front-end has components for a quick pick list for each question.

-   For each question, PLANNING_MODEL determines if clarification is necessary and injects follow-up question. When information sufficient, prompt AI with bound section + user answers + relevant text-only section samples from RAG: As the user answers, a planning AI model (likely GPT-5 specialized for planning flows) will evaluate if the answer is complete or if something is unclear/missing. If a user's answer is too short or ambiguous, the system might ask a follow-up question to clarify details before attempting to draft. It basically ensures the input data is rich enough. This dynamic Q&A is tailored by an AI rather than static. Once the planning model is satisfied that it has enough information for a section, it will then formulate a prompt for the writing model. This prompt will include the section outline and any specific instructions (like "Write the <REDACTED_FOR_IP> using the following info..."), the user's collected answers for that section, and additionally relevant text-only samples from RAG for that section. Those samples could be excerpts from similar sections in past <REDACTED_FOR_IP> or official guidelines text, stripped of formatting (since it says text-only) to help the model understand style or content expected. This is essentially retrieval-augmented generation: providing the model context from relevant documents to improve its draft. The result is the AI's draft for that section.

-   When exporting, convert JSONB <REDACTED_FOR_IP> to canonical markdown, then to .docx and PDF using deterministic conversion library: The <REDACTED_FOR_IP> likely is stored in a structured form in the database (JSONB is a Postgres JSON column type, which suggests they store the <REDACTED_FOR_IP> content and structure as JSON for flexibility). To export, they first transform that JSON structure into a well-defined Markdown format (so each section becomes a markdown heading and content, maybe lists, etc.). Then, using a deterministic library (meaning not AI, but a fixed program, likely something like Pandoc or a specific **DO**CX/PDF library), they convert that markdown into a .docx and PDF. Doing it deterministically ensures the output format is consistent and not subject to AI variability. This way, the PDF is "perfectly formatted" -- they can control page breaks, fonts, etc., probably by using a template or style file in the conversion process. The mention of deterministic library implies no guesswork; the styling might mirror an official <REDACTED_FOR_IP> template if available (like if an official PDF form exists, maybe they mimic that).

-   VALIDATION_MODEL ensures text-only information is complete and aligned with <REDACTED_FOR_IP> requirements, prompts user if not: After drafting but presumably before finalizing, another AI model (the validation model, GPT-5 as specified) checks the content to see if anything is missing or doesn't actually address the questions asked by the <REDACTED_FOR_IP>. It's like a QA check. If it finds an important element missing (maybe a required section or a detail like <REDACTED_FOR_IP> that wasn't filled), it will prompt the user to provide or clarify that information. This likely happens prior to finalizing a section or at least before export. The "text-only information" suggests it's looking at the textual content (not formatting) and comparing to known requirements from the template.

-   FORMATTING_MODEL polishes text for grammar, clarity, and conciseness, designs PDF layout to align with RAG_template and/or RAG_samples. If RAG_template is official template, ensure all required sections present and correctly labeled. This indicates a final AI pass focused on style: a formatting model (also GPT-5, or maybe a specialized fine-tune) goes through the drafted text to improve grammar, clarity, and brevity (making sure the text reads well). It also possibly inserts or adjusts headings and layout instructions for the PDF to match the official format. If there was an official template from RAG (say the <REDACTED_FOR_IP> provided a template document), it ensures the output PDF has those exact section titles and ordering, etc. It's a double-check that nothing was left out and everything is labeled as expected (e.g., if a <REDACTED_FOR_IP> says the section must be called "Project Description", not "Project Overview", the model will ensure correct labeling). Essentially, it fine-tunes both the language quality and the formatting consistency. Using an AI for this allows context-aware editing rather than just basic spellcheck (for clarity improvements like rephrasing sentences for impact).

-   User is presented with final view, containing formatted PDF preview. User can change to text-only view. Once all sections are done and formatted, the UI likely shows a preview of the final PDF (maybe via an embedded PDF viewer or generated image). The user can see exactly how it will look. They also have the option to switch to a text-only view (perhaps a plain markdown or a simple HTML view of the content). This could be useful if they want to copy-paste or quickly edit text without dealing with PDF. Or just to inspect text for any issues that might be hidden by formatting. It's a helpful feature for final review.

-   User may export file as PDF, docx, or md at any time. Even mid-process, it sounds like the user can download what they have so far in any of those formats (though the prime use is at the end). That's user-friendly; maybe they want to share a draft early. It also means the code should allow partial exports (maybe just fill incomplete sections with placeholders or warnings). "At any time" implies a user can always trigger an export, not necessarily gating it after completing all sections, though final output is best when all done.

-   File remains saved to ACTIVE_ORG_ID with USER as PRIMARY_AUTHOR for later exporting or editing.After completion (or even if not completed), the <REDACTED_FOR_IP> is saved in the database associated with the organization (multi-tenant model) and the user who created it marked as primary author. It means later the user or their team can reopen the project, continue editing or export again. It's not one-time use; things persist. They keep track of authorship (maybe for version history or attribution if multiple collaborators). This ties into collaboration and versioning features (like possibly showing who last edited or created it).

Why Useful: This technical interaction flow is extremely detailed and ensures the AI and developers have a clear blueprint of how information flows through the system and where each AI component fits in. It covers the integration of multiple AI models (planning, writing, validation, formatting) and how they interplay with user inputs and data stores (RAG, JSONB <REDACTED_FOR_IP>, etc.). For the AI assistant developing this, it clarifies where to implement what: for example, an "agentic web search" tool integration, an OCR pipeline, snippet library, etc. It's essentially the heart of the system's intelligence. Each step likely translates to specific tasks or modules:

-   RBAC & Plan enforcement module,

-   RAG search module,

-   Template creation agent,

-   Q&A form generator,

-   OCR service integration,

-   Snippets manager,

-   Planning AI (for clarifications),

-   Section writer AI,

-   Exporter module (with markdown conversion and Pandoc or similar),

-   Validation AI,

-   Formatting AI,

-   Front-end preview toggler,

-   Persistence logic for saving and retrieving <REDACTED_FOR_IP>.

Having this sequence helps ensure nothing is forgotten during development (from data ingestion to final output) and that each piece aligns with the product goals (like ensuring official compliance via template matching, ease of use via pre-filled info, etc.). It also highlights where performance might be a concern (OCR for large files, multiple AI calls per section -- maybe needing caching results like the "cache template" step suggests).

Extra setting examples: Not many products have such an elaborate AI-driven flow documented; this is quite thorough. One might omit some pieces if simplifying (e.g., not doing the web search and just making the user manually structure unknown <REDACTED_FOR_IP>, but that's a standout feature here). If any step were too ambitious, they might mark it as optional for v1, but since it's here, presumably they intend to include it.

AI_METRICS_LOGGED | PER_CALL\
Interpretation: The system will log metrics for AI usage per each API call to an AI model. That means every time the AI assistant invokes OpenAI or Gemini or any model, it records metrics about that invocation. "Per call" suggests granular logging rather than aggregated per session or per user action.\
Why Useful: Fine-grained logging allows tracking usage for cost (knowing how many tokens each call used), performance (latency per call), and debugging (which inputs yielded what outputs, possibly). It's essential for monitoring spending especially with a freemium model (they might limit how many AI calls a free user can trigger). It also aids in improving the system by seeing which calls are frequent or fail. Additionally, it ties into analytics and maybe user-facing usage stats if they plan to show how much of their quota has been used.\
Extra setting examples: Sometimes one might log per session or just summary metrics. But per call is thorough. Another value could be `PER_SECTION` or `PER_USER` if aggregated. They chose the most detailed (with presumably some summary too later).

AI_METRICS_LOG_CONTENT | TOKENS; DURATION; MODEL; USER; ACTIVE_ORG; PROPOSAL_ID; SECTION_ID; RESPONSE_SUMMARY\
Interpretation: For each AI model call, they want to record the following details:

-   Tokens: number of tokens used (likely input and output token counts, for cost and complexity tracking).

-   Duration: time taken for the model to respond (to monitor latency or performance issues).

-   Model: which model was called (GPT-5 vs Gemini vs MiniLM etc., useful if they switch models or want to compare performance/cost).

-   User: which user triggered the call (for attribution or rate limiting or analysis of usage patterns per user).

-   Active_org: which organization that user belongs to or was active (for org-level usage tracking; e.g., if a whole org of multiple users has a quota or they want to see which orgs use the AI the most).

-   Proposal_ID: which <REDACTED_FOR_IP> project this call is associated with (so they can trace calls to specific documents or processes, maybe to identify <REDACTED_FOR_IP> that took many tries or had complexity).

-   Section_ID: which section of the <REDACTED_FOR_IP> (if applicable) this call was for. This granularity can tell, for example, that the "<REDACTED_FOR_IP>" section AI call often uses more tokens (maybe because it's large) or tends to need multiple attempts.

-   Response_summary: a summary of the AI's response (not the full text, but perhaps the first few words or a short gist). This is likely to allow easier search in logs or quick understanding of what the AI did without storing complete potentially sensitive text (for privacy, they might avoid full content logs). A summary might be like "Drafted <REDACTED_FOR_IP>" or "Formatted text." This helps in debugging or reviewing the AI's output quality without revealing everything (especially if content is sensitive <REDACTED_FOR_IP> data, summarizing might hide specifics but show general outcome).

Why Useful: Logging these fields provides a comprehensive picture for monitoring and improving the AI features. They can analyze average tokens per call to optimize prompts, see which model is being called most, identify if any user or org is abusing or heavily using the system, correlate duration with user experience (if calls are too slow for some model). The <REDACTED_FOR_IP> and section linkage means they can detect if certain sections systematically cause long calls or errors (maybe the AI struggles with budgets, so they know to adjust that prompt). The response summary can be used if they ever need to troubleshoot a specific output that was bad -- they can locate it via logs. This logging strategy aligns with a data-driven approach to refine the service and also might feed into billing if they later charge for excessive use.\
Extra setting examples: Additional metrics could include the prompt size (though tokens covers that partly), or costs if they compute cost per call (OpenAI gives a cost per 1K tokens, so they could calculate cost per call). They could log whether the call was successful or had an error too. But the list given is robust. Some might omit user info if they worry about privacy, but since it's internal logs, it's fine. The summary is a nice touch -- not all systems do that.

SAVE_STATE | AFTER_EACH_INTERACTION\
Interpretation: The application will save the current state/progress after each interaction with the user. "Interaction" likely means after each user action or each step in the workflow (like after answering a question, after an AI draft completes, etc.). It's basically an auto-save mechanism. For example, when the user completes a section or even partially through, the data is saved, so if something crashes or they close the browser, they don't lose progress.\
Why Useful: <REDACTED_FOR_IP> is a lengthy process. If a user lost what they've input or what the AI drafted due to a glitch, it would be very frustrating. Saving state frequently ensures that at most minimal work is lost (if anything). It's also needed to allow the "later editing" mentioned --- you can leave and come back. Implementing this likely means every relevant API call writes to the database the updated <REDACTED_FOR_IP> JSONB or section content. It also ties into versioning; since they keep last 5 versions, they need to save to have versions. This also helps collaboration (though if multi-user editing, a more continuous sync might be needed, but at least after each user's action, it's saved).\
Extra setting examples: Some might opt for manual save or save on certain milestones, but after each interaction is user-friendly. They might throttle it a bit (e.g., not after every keystroke, but each completed answer or button press triggers save).

VERSIONING | KEEP_LAST_5_VERSIONS\
Interpretation: The system will keep the last 5 versions of the <REDACTED_FOR_IP> (likely automatically). Each time a change is saved (maybe a section finalized or the whole <REDACTED_FOR_IP> state after some major edit), it records a version, and if versions exceed 5, it discards the oldest. This gives a short history for recovery. It's not full version control, but a simple safeguard.\
Why Useful: If the user or AI makes a mistake or if the user wants to revert some changes, having up to 5 prior states allows rolling back. Also, if collaboration is involved, someone might undo another's changes by retrieving an older version. It also might be used for the paid plan feature "versioning" -- perhaps free users get 5, paid might get more or labeled versions. But given this config, at least 5 are stored for everyone, which is decent. It's also helpful for auditing the AI's changes: if an AI revision made the text worse, the user can go back one version.\
Extra setting examples: They could increase that for paid or in general. Or implement full history with diffs (more complex). But 5 gives a balance of some backup without huge storage needs. Another approach is `KEEP_ALL_VERSIONS_FOR_30_DAYS` etc., but they keep it simple.

All the above defines how the core feature (AI-assisted <REDACTED_FOR_IP> drafting) works and ensures reliability (with saving and versioning). The AI will rely on these instructions to implement each piece carefully and test that user flow end-to-end.

Next, the configuration outlines some workspace-specific files (like task lists and documentation index), then details about integrated services and technology stack, followed by critical policies on security, auth, privacy, etc. The AI needs to follow all those as it writes code or documentation.

[FILE_VARS] -- Workspace-Specific File References
------------------------------------------------

*This section provides file paths for various important documents and lists in the project's repository.*

TASK_LIST | /ToDo.md\
Interpretation: This is the path to the project's To-Do list in markdown format, located at the root (as "ToDo.md"). It likely contains tasks, features to implement, bugs to fix, etc., and is meant to be actively maintained. The AI and developers can refer to this file for the current backlog or upcoming work.\
Why Useful: Knowing this path, the AI can update the ToDo list as needed when tasks are completed or new tasks are identified (in line with AFTER_ACTION_ALIGNMENT which mentions updating TO**DO** if outdated). It ensures there is a central place to manage tasks. Because it's listed under FILE_VARS, it's easy for the AI to find and not hard-code the path elsewhere.\
Extra setting examples: Some projects might use an issue tracker instead, but here a ToDo.md is being used, perhaps for simplicity or because this might be a single-developer or small team scenario. Other names could be `TASKS.md` or using a project management tool. But having it in version control is straightforward.

DOCS_INDEX | /docs/readme.md\
Interpretation: This is the index file for documentation located in the docs directory, named readme.md. It's likely the main documentation entry point (maybe with a table of contents) for all project docs. Possibly a place to list all the documentation files or an introduction to the documentation.\
Why Useful: The AI will use this to ensure documentation is well-organized. When it updates or adds docs, it should update this index if needed (like adding links to new docs). It's also where a developer or user might start when browsing the docs directory. Knowing the exact location helps the AI avoid confusion with the public readme at the root, which is separate.\
Extra setting examples: They specifically named it readme.md under docs, which is common. Alternatively, some might call it docs/INDEX.md or similar. But readme is fine as many static site generators or GitHub will display docs/readme.md when viewing the folder.

PUBLIC_PRODUCT_ORIENTED_README | /readme.md\
Interpretation: The main README at the repository root is meant to be product-oriented (public facing). This file likely contains an overview of the product, features, and maybe a quick start, aimed at someone who lands on the repo or initial project page. It's not focusing on dev instructions but on what the product is (for potential users or evaluators). This could double as a marketing piece if the repo is open or if shared with stakeholders.\
Why Useful: By distinguishing this from the dev docs, it ensures the AI tailors content appropriately. When updating documentation in alignment, it won't clutter the main readme with developer-centric details. Instead, it might update it with broad changes (like if key features changed, reflect that). It's also likely shown on the GitHub front page, so it should be polished and concise.\
Extra setting examples: Some projects keep one README with everything, but they have product vs dev separation. Another example could be linking to a website or using a separate docs site for product info. But they chose to keep a product intro in the repo which is fine for an open source or internal project that might become open.

DEV_README | design_system.md; ops_runbook.md; rls_postgres.md; security_hardening.md; install_guide.md; frontend_design_bible.md\
Interpretation: This is a list of specific developer-oriented documentation files:

-   design_system.md: Likely details on UI components, styles, and general design principles (maybe a mini style guide or how to use components in front-end).

-   ops_runbook.md: Operational runbook -- instructions for deploying, monitoring, recovering the system (great for on-call or DevOps).

-   rls_postgres.md: Documentation on using Row-Level Security in Postgres for this project. This might cover how RLS is configured, how to add new policies for multi-tenancy, etc., since RLS is critical here.

-   security_hardening.md: Guidelines or checklists for securing the app (could cover environment config, dependency checks, secret management etc., some likely from [SECURITY] section).

-   install_guide.md: Steps to install or set up the development environment (and possibly deploy). Could include prerequisites, how to run locally, etc. They also mention user checklist linking to install_guide, so it's probably comprehensive.

-   frontend_design_bible.md: Possibly an extensive guide for front-end architecture and best practices (maybe covering React structure, state management, how to use Tailwind, etc.). "Bible" implies it's a central guiding doc for front-end code.

Why Useful: By listing these, the config tells the AI these docs exist (or should exist) and need maintenance. It implies any changes to related systems should reflect here. For example, if they change something about RLS usage, update rls_postgres.md. If they alter the CI/CD, update ops_runbook.md and security_hardening if relevant. It's part of keeping docs up-to-date and consistent. It also guides new developers: these are the key internal docs to read. The AI will ensure, per the alignment rules, that after code changes it might need to update one of these if the content is now outdated.\
Extra setting examples: Projects might not break docs into so many files, but it's good they did -- it shows focus on different areas. One could also have an API documentation file if there was a public API, but maybe not needed for this product.

USER_CHECKLIST | /docs/install_guide.md\
Interpretation: The "user checklist" is pointing to the install guide in docs. It's somewhat confusing name -- perhaps it means for a developer or admin user to ensure installation is complete, or maybe for the end user to check if everything is set up in their account? But likely it means a developer or deployer checklist. However, since it's exactly install_guide.md, perhaps they reuse that doc as a checklist for whoever is setting up the project (with bullet points to tick off).\
Why Useful: It signals that the install_guide is critical (they even flagged in BUILD_CONFIG that keeping it up-to-date is critical). The AI must make sure it's accurate because if not, new developers might fail to install or deploy properly. It being called a checklist suggests it's structured as a list of steps or items that must be done. Possibly used by the AI or user to verify environment completeness.\
Extra setting examples: They could have separate quickstart vs detailed installation, but seems combined. Ensuring this is always correct (like if a dependency is added, update install_guide) is indeed critical. The config double-emphasizes it by mentioning it in build config and here.

[MODEL_CONTEXT_PROTOCOL_SERVERS] -- Integrated Services (MCP)
------------------------------------------------------------

*This section appears to list external or third-party services used for various purposes like security scanning, billing, etc., possibly as part of a "Model Context Protocol" or just system integration.*

SECURITY | SNYK\
Interpretation: For security scanning of code and dependencies, the project uses Snyk. Snyk is a service that scans for known vulnerabilities in libraries, checks code for issues, etc. It suggests that in CI or development, they run Snyk or use its GitHub integration to catch security problems.\
Why Useful: The AI will integrate Snyk in the workflow, as we saw: run security audit tool is set to true in validation. Also, they mention SNYK false positives elsewhere, meaning Snyk will be a regular part of QA. Knowing it's Snyk specifically might mean the AI will use Snyk's CLI (which exists) or an API. It also means the AI's code suggestions should avoid introducing dependencies with known Snyk issues (since that'll flag in CI). So it might cross-check if a library is flagged by Snyk DB.\
Extra setting examples: Other projects might use GitHub Dependabot, OWASP Dependency Check, or others. They chose Snyk, a popular SaaS tool which also has an open source product. Possibly because it covers multiple languages.

BILLING | STRIPE\
Interpretation: The project will use Stripe for handling billing and payments. Stripe is a leading payment processor for subscriptions. This likely covers the paid plan upgrades, subscription management, possibly metered billing if they choose.\
Why Useful: The AI will ensure integration with Stripe's API for creating customers, processing payments, subscription tiers, webhooks for successful payments, etc. It influences how to implement the paywall gating: e.g., the AI might suggest using Stripe Checkout or the Stripe subscription API in Django. It also means storing things like Stripe customer IDs, subscription statuses in the database. Since Stripe is popular, there are libraries (like djstripe or custom code). The AI might consider using those.\
Extra setting examples: Alternatives are PayPal, Braintree, or self-hosted payments, but Stripe is developer-friendly and common for SaaS, so a good choice.

CODE_QUALITY | RUFF; ESLINT; VITEST\
Interpretation: The code quality tooling includes:

-   Ruff: a fast Python linter (it checks for style and some errors, akin to flake8/pyflakes but written in Rust). This will enforce Python code style and catch bugs.

-   ESLint: a linter for JavaScript/TypeScript, to enforce code style and catch JS/TS issues.

-   Vitest: a testing framework for front-end (like Jest but the Vite-native solution). This implies they will write unit tests for the front-end using Vitest. Possibly also for back-end, though not mentioned (maybe using PyTest but they didn't list it, interestingly).\
    These cover static analysis (ruff, eslint) and testing (vitest).

Why Useful: By specifying these, the AI should incorporate them into CI and possibly run them locally after changes. It also means following their rules when writing code (for example, if Ruff forbids unused imports, the AI should avoid that to keep linter happy; if ESLint has certain style rules, abide by them). Vitest indicates that they want tests for front-end. The AI, when writing front-end code, might also write corresponding Vitest tests. Similarly, one might guess for Python they plan to use PyTest even though not listed explicitly; maybe they rely on just using Django's test runner or incorporate security tests through Snyk and RUFF for style.\
Extra setting examples: They could add more (like Prettier for formatting, but maybe ESLint covers formatting with rules, or could assume Prettier is used implicitly with ESLint). They might have omitted PyTest by oversight or assume Django's test framework by default. But anyway, these three cover major areas.

TO_PROPOSE_NEW_MCP | ASK_USER_WITH_REASONING\
Interpretation: If the AI (or developers) think about integrating a new external service or Model Context Protocol server not currently configured, it should ask the user (or project owner) first and provide reasoning for why the new integration is needed. In other words, don't spontaneously add new major third-party services or tools without approval, and be prepared to justify it.\
Why Useful: This keeps the stack and integrations controlled. New services can introduce cost, complexity, or risk (security, data privacy concerns). By requiring a rationale and user approval, it ensures that every additional dependency is scrutinized. For the AI, if it thought "maybe use a different AI API or add a library for X that calls an external service," it should hold off and discuss with the user. Essentially, it prevents scope creep or unnecessary complexity from sneaking in.\
Extra setting examples: An alternative could be `AUTO_APPROVE_IF_FREE` or something, but they chose always ask, which is safer. It might rarely come up, but it's a good guardrail.

Next, the [STACK] section gives concrete tech stack choices. The AI will need to stick to these when generating code and not deviate.

[STACK] -- Technology Stack (Lightweight, Secure, Maintainable, Production Ready)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*This section enumerates the chosen frameworks, languages, and components for each part of the system.*

FRAMEWORKS | DJANGO; REACT\
Interpretation: The main frameworks are Django for the back-end and React for the front-end. Django (Python web framework) will handle the server-side logic, API, database models, etc., while React (JavaScript/TypeScript library) will handle the client-side UI. This confirms the earlier front-end/back-end split with these specific technologies.\
Why Useful: It sets the development direction: the AI will use Django conventions (models, views or DRF if API, etc.) and React for building the UI (probably as a SPA). Both are well-known, widely supported frameworks which aligns with maintainability. It also means the AI should not propose something like Angular or Flask since the frameworks are decided. It ensures consistency in solution approaches (e.g., use Django's ORM for database, use React components and hooks for UI).\
Extra setting examples: If they had chosen others, like Express + Vue, those would be listed instead. Many modern stacks choose Django + React for an all-around solution. It's robust for an MVP and beyond.

BACK-END | PYTHON_3.12\
Interpretation: The back-end will use Python 3.12 (a relatively new version of Python, beyond 3.11). This specifies the exact major.minor version the code should target. Python 3.12 suggests they want to use the latest features available (maybe 3.12 is in pre-release as of 2025? Actually, by late 2025, Python 3.12 might be released or soon to be).\
Why Useful: This tells the AI to use Python 3.12 syntax and features (like maybe improved performance, new typing or pattern matching enhancements, etc.). It also affects dependency compatibility (the AI should ensure libraries are compatible with 3.12). Setting it now means they likely intend to run on the latest Python, which aligns with being forward-compatible. It also means no need to maintain older Python compatibility.\
Extra setting examples: If the environment only supported 3.10, they'd list that. 3.12 being listed suggests they might plan container or environment upgrade to that version. Another config could be specifying micro version if needed (but usually not necessary).

FRONT-END | TYPESCRIPT_5; TAILWIND_CSS; RENDERED_HTML_VIA_REACT\
Interpretation: The front-end specifics:

-   TypeScript 5: They will write the front-end code in TypeScript (version 5.x), not plain JavaScript. TypeScript ensures type safety. TS5 is a recent version, implying using modern features.

-   Tailwind CSS: They will use Tailwind CSS for styling. Tailwind is a utility-first CSS framework that lets you use classes to style components quickly. This fits the minimal styling approach; developers can add classes for spacing, colors, etc., without writing a separate CSS file for each thing. It's modern and keeps styles consistent.

-   Rendered HTML via React: This suggests that all HTML content will be rendered using React (i.e., no server-side templating for HTML, reinforcing that Django might just serve JSON APIs). React will produce the HTML for the browser dynamically. This might also hint that they are not doing server-side rendering initially (just client-side).

Why Useful: Using TypeScript improves code quality and maintainability on the front-end (catches errors early, documents types). Tailwind speeds up UI development and ensures a consistent design without handcrafting every CSS rule. It aligns with "clean, whitespace, modern" design. Also, since styling is deferred, Tailwind can allow quick adjustments when they do style. Rendered HTML via React confirms the architecture: the AI should implement all UI as React components that produce HTML; do not use Django templates. It also implies possibly an SPA that interacts with the Django backend via API calls (maybe using fetch/axios).\
Extra setting examples: Could have been plain JS (which would be riskier) or using CSS frameworks like Bootstrap (but Tailwind is more modern). If they wanted SSR or static generation, they might have specified Next.js or similar, but they didn't, indicating likely a simpler SPA.

DATABASE | POSTGRESQL // RLS_ENABLED\
Interpretation: The database is PostgreSQL, and importantly, Row-Level Security (RLS) is enabled. This means they'll use Postgres's RLS feature to enforce data segregation among tenants (organizations). Postgres is a powerful, stable choice that supports JSONB, which they need, and RLS ensures that even if a query doesn't have a filter, the DB itself will restrict rows by some policy (like each row has an org_id and the DB ensures a connection only sees its org's data).\
Why Useful: Postgres being the DB, the AI will use Django's PostgreSQL features (maybe specific fields like JSONField which maps to JSONB, etc.). The RLS enabled means the AI should plan database migrations to set up RLS policies, and code to set the appropriate role or session context (likely using PostgreSQL's `app_user`or `current_setting('org_id')` trick or using Django's multi-tenant support). It ensures security at the lowest layer, which is great for preventing data leaks between organizations. The AI must make sure any direct SQL accounts for RLS.\
Extra setting examples: They could have chosen MySQL or others, but Postgres is the pick for RLS and JSON. The comment `// RLS_ENABLED` highlights a critical config aspect. Possibly the AI needs to ensure that for each query or connection, it sets the proper Postgres role or session variable to activate RLS filtering (e.g., `SET myapp.current_org = X`). They likely documented how in rls_postgres.md.

MIGRATIONS_REVERSIBLE | TRUE\
Interpretation: Database migrations should be written such that they can be reversed (rolled back) reliably. `TRUE` means whenever a migration is created, it should include a `reverse` operation (Django migrations usually do this by default unless you write raw SQL without reverse). It also implies testing downgrades.\
Why Useful: In case of deployment issues or a migration that had a bug, being able to rollback the database schema is vital for quick recovery. It's a discipline to avoid irreversible operations (like deleting data without backups, or raw SQL that can't be undone). The AI, when generating migrations, should ensure `operations`have reverse counterparts or at least mark it possible. It also might avoid data migrations that lose info. This aligns with the reliability goal.\
Extra setting examples: If false, they might not care about rollback, but here they do. Some migrations (like dropping a column) are inherently irreversible unless you recompute data, so they might avoid such destructive changes unless absolutely needed, or ensure they double-check before finalizing.

CACHE | REDIS\
Interpretation: The project will use Redis as a caching layer. Redis is an in-memory key-value store often used to cache query results, session data, etc., for quick access. It's also going to be used as the broker for Celery tasks as noted later.\
Why Useful: Using Redis can greatly improve performance for expensive operations (like caching RAG search results, or storing in-progress state for the AI flows maybe). It also centralizes ephemeral data that needs to be shared between processes (like session info if using Redis for JWT blacklist or similar). The AI should incorporate caching for things like template search results (they mention caching found templates), or even caching AI results for repeated queries. Also, since they have multiple services (Django, Celery, possibly any websockets or so), Redis can coordinate.\
Extra setting examples: They might have used Memcached, but Redis offers more features (like persistence, data structures). It's the typical choice for Django caching and Celery.

RAG_STORE | MONGODB_ATLAS_W_ATLAS_SEARCH\
Interpretation: The Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) data (templates, samples, snippets) will be stored in MongoDB Atlas using Atlas Search for querying. Atlas Search is a full-text search engine integrated into MongoDB Atlas, with capabilities for text and possibly vector search. They chose MongoDB likely because it's flexible (storing templates and samples of varying format easily as documents) and Atlas Search provides a convenient way to do the semantic or keyword searches they need without building a separate search infrastructure.\
Why Useful: This component will hold all external knowledge the AI uses in drafting (templates, sample <REDACTED_FOR_IP>, etc.). By using Atlas Search, they can do complex queries (like search by keywords, fuzzy match, maybe even integration with embedding-based search if Atlas supports vector queries---Atlas Search in 2025 may support synonyms or basic semantic but maybe not true vector, unless they map MiniLM vectors to fields). The AI will use the MongoDB Python driver for storing and retrieving, or possibly integrate an ORM-like layer. It also means that whenever new templates are discovered, they insert them here. This is separate from Postgres (which is for transactional data like user accounts, <REDACTED_FOR_IP>), which is wise because these RAG docs might be large and not strictly relational.\
Extra setting examples: They could have used a dedicated vector database or just Postgres full-text search. But Atlas Search likely gives them a powerful full-text search out of the box with minimal config, and Mongo suits storing JSON docs (like templates with fields as JSON). Also, using a separate store segregates concerns and possibly scales independently.

ASYNC_TASKS | CELERY // REDIS_BROKER\
Interpretation: Asynchronous/background tasks will be handled by Celery, using Redis as the message broker. Celery is a Python task queue that lets you run tasks in the background (like long-running or scheduled tasks) outside the main web process. Redis will serve as the broker (the queue system where tasks are pushed and workers listen) and possibly for result backend (unless they use something else for result).\
Why Useful: Many of the AI-related tasks (like heavy model calls, web scraping, OCR) may be offloaded to Celery to avoid blocking user requests. For example, generating a draft might be done asynchronously while the user sees a loading spinner. Celery ensures tasks can be distributed across worker processes or servers, improving scalability. Using Redis as broker is common for Celery due to its speed. The AI should structure tasks such as "fetch_and_create_template" (for unknown <REDACTED_FOR_IP> search), "generate_section_draft", "run_validation", etc., as Celery tasks. This also ties into metrics logging and possibly enabling a better user experience (they could even allow the user to navigate away while tasks complete).\
Extra setting examples: They could have chosen something like RQ (Redis Queue) or a cloud function, but Celery is mature and integrates well with Django. The Redis broker is already in place for caching, so it's convenient.

AI_PROVIDERS | OPENAI; GOOGLE_GEMINI; LOCAL\
Interpretation: The system can use multiple AI providers: OpenAI (for GPT models likely), Google Gemini(Google's AI model platform, presumably competitor to GPT-4/5), and Local (some local model for maybe embeddings or fallback if offline). This suggests a flexible architecture where certain tasks might go to different AI endpoints. Possibly they intend to use OpenAI's GPT-5 for main tasks, Google's model for some tasks (like they assigned web_scraping_model to Gemini), and a local model for embeddings (they mention MiniLM for local).\
Why Useful: Multi-provider support avoids vendor lock-in and could optimize cost or performance. For instance, they might prefer OpenAI for highest quality text generation, but could use Google for any features OpenAI doesn't have or for diversification. A local model ensures they aren't fully reliant on API costs for embeddings or maybe simple tasks. The AI will design the code to abstract the AI calls such that switching provider for a given task is easy (perhaps via an interface or configuration). It also allows fallback if one API is down or too expensive.\
Extra setting examples: They listed likely all they intend to use. In the future could add `ANTHROPIC` or others if needed, but they'd then follow the rule to ask user to add new. Right now these three suffice.

AI_MODELS | GPT-5; GEMINI-2.5-PRO; MiniLM-L6-v2\
Interpretation: These are the specific AI model names they plan to use:

-   GPT-5: Presumably the next-gen large language model from OpenAI (a step beyond GPT-4). This would be used for most heavy text generation tasks (planning, writing, etc.).

-   GEMINI-2.5-PRO: Possibly a specific tier/version of Google's Gemini model (2.5 could mean version 2.5, Pro might indicate high capability or paid tier).

-   MiniLM-L6-v2: A smaller local model (Microsoft's MiniLM, 6-layer version 2) often used for generating embeddings for semantic search, which aligns with them using it for embedding and search tasks.

Why Useful: It enumerates exactly which models correspond to the providers above. GPT-5 presumably via OpenAI, Gemini via Google's API, and MiniLM probably via local code (like from a library such as HuggingFace Transformers). The AI will incorporate calls to these models accordingly: e.g., use OpenAI API for GPT-5 tasks, use Google's PaLM/Gemini API for that model, and either run MiniLM locally or via a small service. It ensures the agent selects the right model for each role defined below (they actually specify which model is used for planning, writing, etc. next).\
Extra setting examples: If GPT-5 isn't available yet, they might currently use GPT-4 and then switch. But writing GPT-5 means planning to upgrade when available, demonstrating future-proofing. They might also fine-tune or have smaller local models for special tasks, but MiniLM is specifically an embedding model, not used for generation.

PLANNING_MODEL | GPT-5\
Interpretation: For tasks involving planning (like deciding sections, asking follow-up questions), they will use GPT-5. This is the model tasked with reasoning out the steps or checking completeness. GPT-5, being a top-tier model, should handle complex reasoning and instructions very well, which is needed for planning.\
Why Useful: Planning often requires understanding context and asking the right questions. By assigning the best model (GPT-5) to this, they increase the chance that the AI will generate good clarifying questions and not miss things. It sets that in code, when they call the planning function, they should call the GPT-5 API.\
Extra setting examples: If cost was a concern they could use GPT-4 or a smaller model, but they choose quality here. Or they could say PLANNING_MODEL = GPT-4 and WRITING_MODEL = GPT-5 to save cost on planning, but likely they consider planning equally critical.

WRITING_MODEL | GPT-5\
Interpretation: The model that actually drafts the <REDACTED_FOR_IP> text for each section is GPT-5 as well. So, generation of content uses the most advanced model for best language quality and coherence.\
Why Useful: Writing the actual <REDACTED_FOR_IP> text is the core value proposition, so they want the highest quality output. GPT-5 presumably offers improvements in fluency and adherence to instructions. This should produce persuasive and well-structured <REDACTED_FOR_IP> sections. Using the same model for both planning and writing keeps things simple (less juggling of multiple model capabilities) and ensures top performance.\
Extra setting examples: They might experiment with using a slightly cheaper model for writing (since writing might consume a lot of tokens), but quality is prioritized. Alternatively, they could decide certain smaller sections use a smaller model, but that adds complexity.

FORMATTING_MODEL | GPT-5\
Interpretation: The formatting and polishing tasks (grammar correction, clarity improvements, ensuring the output matches template style) are also done by GPT-5. So essentially, all heavy NLP tasks use GPT-5.\
Why Useful: This ensures consistency in writing style; the same model that wrote the text can refine it. GPT-5 can likely fix grammar with ease and understand context (where a smaller grammar checker might not understand the content's context as well). It also simplifies integration - one API for all text tasks. The cost might be high using GPT-5 for even formatting, but they may accept that or assume some fine-tuning or smaller method might not catch everything.\
Extra setting examples: They could use something like Grammarly API or a smaller model for grammar, but that might not catch <REDACTED_FOR_IP>-specific tone issues. Sticking to GPT-5 yields top results at cost of tokens. Possibly formatting a section is less token-intensive than generating it from scratch, so cost difference may not be huge anyway.

WEB_SCRAPING_MODEL | GEMINI-2.5-PRO\
Interpretation: For tasks involving web scraping or reading content from the web to get templates (the agentic search step), they'll use Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro model. This suggests that perhaps Gemini might have better capabilities at reading web content or maybe more lenient usage for that kind of operation. It might also diversify usage (maybe to not overuse OpenAI tokens if not needed). Possibly, Google's model could handle extraction of structured data from web pages or working with the content of PDFs or HTML better.\
Why Useful: By using Gemini for scraping tasks, they spread the load and possibly leverage any unique strengths of that model (maybe it's good at summarizing web content or has some browsing tool integration). It also might be a fallback if the OpenAI policy doesn't allow certain content (Google might allow different content? Or just to experiment). From an integration view, they'll call Google's API when they need to analyze web content found. This decouples that from other operations so they can optimize each.\
Extra setting examples: They could have used GPT for everything, but this indicates an intention to multi-source. Another rationale might be Google's pricing or data handling is better for large content chunks from web, but that's speculation.

VALIDATION_MODEL | GPT-5\
Interpretation: The validation step (checking completeness and alignment with requirements) uses GPT-5. No surprise here, given that requires understanding what's needed vs. what's given, which is complex reasoning and reading through the content thoroughly.\
Why Useful: GPT-5 can analyze long texts (if it has expanded context window by then) and instructions, so it's suited to verify if the <REDACTED_FOR_IP> answers all parts of the RFP. It can also pick up subtle omissions or mismatches. They want the best reasoning model here to avoid any oversight because a missed requirement could mean a failed <REDACTED_FOR_IP>.\
Extra setting examples: They likely wouldn't trust a smaller model with this either. Possibly one might attempt a rule-based check (like search for keywords), but an LLM doing it is more flexible.

SEMANTIC_EMBEDDING_MODEL | MiniLM-L6-v2\
Interpretation: For generating embeddings for semantic similarity (for RAG search, snippet similarity, etc.), they use MiniLM-L6-v2. This is a small, fast model that produces vector embeddings (like 384-dim) and is known for good performance in semantic search tasks relative to its size. It's likely run locally via a library (like SentenceTransformers).\
Why Useful: Using MiniLM locally means no cost per call and fast calculation of vectors. It's ideal for creating embedding of user queries or documents to feed into Atlas Search if they do hybrid search (Atlas might allow custom embeddings search, or they could just approximate with text search). At least, MiniLM can be used to implement semantic search on their own (like computing cosine similarity). It aligns with wanting an open source or local solution for embeddings (since they wouldn't want to call an API like OpenAI for every snippet vector due to cost and privacy).\
Extra setting examples: If not MiniLM, they might have used OpenAI's embeddings (like Ada v2) but that costs per call. Or other models like MPNet or similar. MiniLM-L6 is a good trade-off.

RAG_SEARCH_MODEL | MiniLM-L6-v2\
Interpretation: The same MiniLM model is used for searching in RAG. Possibly this means if they implement vector search themselves, they'll embed both query and docs with MiniLM and then compare. It might also mean that Atlas Search is configured to use custom embeddings from MiniLM for semantic search. Or simpler: they embed query with MiniLM, then search Atlas with those vectors if Atlas supports it (Atlas Search might support a stored embedding vector per doc and a $vectorSearch operator).\
Why Useful: Using the same model for indexing and querying ensures consistency (embedding space matches). It's efficient and again doesn't call external services. They likely store MiniLM vector for each chunk of text in Mongo (maybe as part of the doc), and at query time, compute vector for query and do similarity search (the note "semantic search technique: ATLAS_SEARCH_SEMANTIC" suggests Atlas might handle it, perhaps by approximate nearest neighbor on vectors stored). Either way, MiniLM is central to their RAG retrieval working well.\
Extra setting examples: If they didn't have Atlas Search, they might have used a separate vector DB or simpler method, but since they do, aligning the model is crucial.

OCR | TESSERACT_LANGUAGE_CONFIGURED // IMAGE, PDF\
Interpretation: For OCR (Optical Character Recognition) on images or PDFs, they are using Tesseract (likely the open source OCR engine), configured for the needed language (probably English, or multi-language if needed). The comment indicates it will handle both images and PDFs (for PDFs, they likely convert pages to images then run Tesseract, or use a PDF text extractor fallback if the PDF contains text). Language configured means if a user uploads, say, a Spanish document, they might adjust Tesseract to Spanish, but since default language is English, presumably Tesseract is set to English to improve accuracy.\
Why Useful: Tesseract is free and can run on their server without external API, which aligns with privacy and cost control. They might incorporate a library like pytesseract to use it. It allows them to extract text from files that the user uploads as answers (like we discussed in flows). It's important they configure it properly (resolution, language packs) for good results. By including it in the stack, they plan for that integration.\
Extra setting examples: They could have used an API like Google Vision or Adobe OCR which might be more accurate, but that would incur cost and require sending user docs to third-party, which is likely against privacy. Tesseract might need some tuning, but is usually fine for typed documents. They mention PDF too, so either they rely on PDFs being text-based (then could parse text directly), or if not, they convert to image and OCR.

ANALYTICS | UMAMI\
Interpretation: They will use Umami as the analytics platform. Umami is an open-source, privacy-friendly web analytics tool (alternative to Google Analytics). It likely ties to that data.<REDACTED_FOR_IP>.dk endpoint (maybe they host Umami at that subdomain). This means the front-end will have a small script to track page views and events, sending them to Umami.\
Why Useful: Using Umami aligns with privacy (no data leaks to Google, and allow user opt-out as they mentioned). It also means they control the data. The AI when implementing analytics will integrate Umami by including its script or using its API. It might also log custom events (like "ProposalCreated", "AISectionDrafted") for product metrics. Because it's self-hosted (on data.<REDACTED_FOR_IP>.dk presumably), it fulfills the privacy promise in [PRIVACY].\
Extra setting examples: If not Umami, they might have not had analytics or used a more heavy solution, but Umami is a good compromise. They might track minimal data given the 'fewest cookies' policy.

FILE_STORAGE | DATABASE; S3_COMPATIBLE; LOCAL_FS\
Interpretation: They plan to support multiple file storage backends for user-uploaded files (and perhaps generated files):

-   Database: storing files directly in the database (likely Postgres) as bytea or in a table. This might be for small files or just one option, though generally storing large files in DB is not ideal unless small or for ease of transactions.

-   S3_Compatible: using an S3-compatible object storage (like AWS S3 or DigitalOcean Spaces, MinIO, etc.) for files, probably in production to handle potentially large file storage with durability and offloading from the app server.

-   Local FS: storing files on the local file system (server disk), probably for development or small deployments.

This indicates they want an abstraction for file storage and might configure it per environment (like dev uses local FS for simplicity, production uses S3).

Why Useful: It gives flexibility. They can default to DB or local for quick start, but scale to S3 for production. Some files might be small textual data that storing in DB is fine (like snippet text might actually be in DB because it's just text), whereas PDFs or images are better in S3. Possibly "DATABASE" is referring to storing them as binary in Postgres for maybe easier RLS protection (since Postgres RLS could secure files as well, but S3 needs a different approach to secure per org; they might generate signed URLs). The AI should design a file storage interface that can handle these backends, probably by using Django's Storage system (it has backends for file storage including default local, or custom S3 via libraries like django-storages).\
Extra setting examples: They mention all three, so presumably they will choose one based on environment. It's unusual to see database storage, but maybe for things like small images or if they want an all-in-one backup, but likely they lean to S3 for large files. The config ensures the AI accounts for all.

BACKUP_STORAGE | S3_COMPATIBLE_VIA_CRON_JOBS\
Interpretation: Backups (presumably of the database and possibly file data) will be stored in an S3-compatible storage, and the backups will be done via cron jobs (scheduled tasks). This means they have a process to regularly dump the database and maybe compress it, then upload to an S3 bucket. Or likewise backup any file system content to S3. Cron jobs suggests it's not integrated into the app itself but rather a server/ops level job (maybe using AWS Data Pipeline or a server script).\
Why Useful: Ensures data durability. If the database server fails, they have copies in S3. Using S3-compatible likely means they could use AWS S3 or any similar service. Cron job approach is straightforward to implement. The AI might need to ensure documentation covers how to set this up (like provide a script or mention in ops_runbook). Also might coordinate with data retention policies - e.g., these backups should be pruned as needed.\
Extra setting examples: They might specify encryption or multi-region, but maybe not in config. S3-compatible is general, meaning it could be AWS, Wasabi, etc.

BACKUP_STRATEGY | DAILY_INCREMENTAL_WEEKLY_FULL\
Interpretation: The backup schedule is to do daily incremental backups and weekly full backups. This is a common strategy to balance backup size and restore convenience.

-   Daily incremental: each day, backup changes since the last full (or last incremental) -- these are smaller and quicker.

-   Weekly full: once a week, do a complete backup of everything.

So if restoring, you'd take the latest full and then apply incrementals since then.

Why Useful: It reduces storage needs compared to full backups every day, and also ensures a recent full backup that doesn't require applying too many increments (worst case apply 6 daily increments if restoring day before next full). It's a good compromise. The AI or ops should implement accordingly (maybe using something like `pg_dump` with WAL archiving for increments or a backup tool that supports incremental diffs, or simply dump daily but only store differences if file-level). Possibly they use something like `aws s3 sync`for files which inherently is incremental by checking timestamps. They might document this in ops_runbook.\
Extra setting examples: They could have chosen daily full for simplicity or real-time streaming. But daily incremental, weekly full is standard for moderately sized data.

The next section [RAG] was touched in the technical flows but let's cover explicitly:

[RAG] -- Retrieval-Augmented Generation Configuration
----------------------------------------------------

*This section describes how they manage stored knowledge for the AI (templates, samples, snippets) and how to search them.*

STORES | TEMPLATES; SAMPLES; SNIPPETS\
Interpretation: They have three categories of documents in their RAG system:

-   TEMPLATES: likely official or structured templates of <REDACTED_FOR_IP> (outline of sections, maybe with instructions for each section). These could come from <REDACTED_FOR_IP>s or crafted by the system.

-   SAMPLES: sample <REDACTED_FOR_IP> (maybe real <REDACTED_FOR_IP> or examples from public sources) that can be used as references for writing style or content. Perhaps categorized by type of <REDACTED_FOR_IP>.

-   SNIPPETS: small pieces of text that users save (as mentioned in user flow) or common text blocks (like mission statements, boilerplate). These are user-generated or possibly provided examples.

Why Useful: By separating them, the system can search or use them differently. For instance, when drafting content, the AI might pull SAMPLE content relevant to the section to see phrasing, but it will use TEMPLATEto ensure structure and required content. SNIPPETS might be inserted directly rather than used as context. The AI can treat each store with appropriate logic. It also aids indexing, because you might search templates by <REDACTED_FOR_IP> name, samples by topic, etc. The design likely means in MongoDB, they have a collection or a field distinguishing these types. It will also allow targeted management (like an admin can add new templates without touching samples).\
Extra setting examples: They could add more stores later, like "Regulations" or "Guidelines" if needed, but those might be considered part of templates or separate category. The three cover the essentials for content generation context.

ORGANIZED_BY | KEYWORDS; TYPE; <REDACTED_FOR_IP>; CALL_PAGE_TITLE; CALL_URL; USAGE_FREQUENCY\
Interpretation: The metadata used to organize (or index) RAG entries includes:

-   Keywords: tags or topics relevant to the content (e.g., "healthcare", "education", etc.). Possibly extracted or manually assigned.

-   Type: likely corresponds to store (template vs sample vs snippet), but could also mean type of <REDACTED_FOR_IP> (like "Official Template", "<REDACTED_FOR_IP> Sample", etc.).

-   <REDACTED_FOR_IP>: the organization or <REDACTED_FOR_IP> entity (like <REDACTED_FOR_IP>) associated with the template or sample. This is crucial because <REDACTED_FOR_IP> often align with <REDACTED_FOR_IP> preferences.

-   <REDACTED_FOR_IP>_page_title: the title of the <REDACTED_FOR_IP> or page from which a template was derived (like the name of the <REDACTED_FOR_IP>).

-   <REDACTED_FOR_IP>_url: the URL where the <REDACTED_FOR_IP> information was found (for traceability or future update checks).

-   Usage_Frequency: how often that snippet or sample has been used or referenced by users. This can be used to rank search results (more frequently used ones might be better), or to suggest popular snippets.

Why Useful: These fields allow flexible searching and filtering. For instance, when a user inputs a URL, the system can find templates where Call_url or keywords match. When writing a section, maybe filter samples by <REDACTED_FOR_IP> or type to give relevant style examples. Usage frequency can help highlight community-vetted content. It's also helpful for maintenance: if some samples never get used, maybe they're not very relevant or could be removed. The AI will ensure to capture these metadata when storing a new template from web search (like parse the title, <REDACTED_FOR_IP> from the page, etc.).\
Extra setting examples: They might include "year" if <REDACTED_FOR_IP> are annual or "region" if needed, but the listed ones are quite comprehensive.

CHUNKING_TECHNIQUE | SEMANTIC\
Interpretation: When breaking down large documents for storage (like a long sample <REDACTED_FOR_IP> or guidelines), they will chunk them using a semantic approach. That usually means splitting by sections or paragraphs that are semantically coherent, rather than just fixed size or random splits. Possibly they might use some algorithm to detect topic shifts or headings.\
Why Useful: It ensures each chunk of text stored in RAG is meaningful on its own and can be used as context without missing half the info. For example, storing each section of a sample <REDACTED_FOR_IP> separately means the AI can retrieve just the relevant section (like how a <REDACTED_FOR_IP> was written) rather than the whole <REDACTED_FOR_IP>. Semantic chunking yields more relevant search results because each result is a coherent thought or piece of content. The AI might implement this by splitting on headings or by a max length that doesn't cut off mid-sentence or uses an AI to decide where to split.\
Extra setting examples: A simpler alternative is fixed-length chunking (e.g., every 512 tokens), but that could break context awkwardly. They explicitly want semantic, which might require more upfront processing.

SEARCH_TECHNIQUE | ATLAS_SEARCH_SEMANTIC\
Interpretation: The search within the RAG store uses MongoDB Atlas Search with semantic capabilities. This likely means they plan to use Atlas's features for either text search that approximates semantic or a vector search if Atlas supports that (some versions of Atlas allow vector indexing by now, which could use the MiniLM vectors). The name suggests maybe Atlas has something specifically called "semantic search" perhaps meaning synonyms or concept-based search.\
Why Useful: Offloading search to Atlas means less custom code for search indexing and ranking. They can push a query through Atlas's search index and get back relevant docs sorted by a score. If integrated with MiniLM (store vectors and search by $vector), that covers true semantic. If not, they might at least use robust text search with weights on fields. This one line confirms the approach and the AI will thus focus on feeding data properly into Atlas (like ensuring the search index is defined to cover those fields and possibly using embeddings). It also implies they trust Atlas Search's performance and features enough to not need an external search engine like Elasticsearch or Pinecone.\
Extra setting examples: Could have been something like `LOCAL_VECTOR_DB` if they planned to run their own, or `BM25` if just keyword search, but they intend a semantic approach which likely means vector-based retrieval or at least concept-based retrieval in Atlas.

Now the [SECURITY] section is quite extensive, covering best practices and required measures.

[SECURITY] -- Critical Security Policies
---------------------------------------

*This section lays out security paradigms and specific measures that must be enforced.*

INTEGRATE_AT_SERVER_OR_PROXY_LEVEL_IF_POSSIBLE | TRUE\
Interpretation: Whenever possible, implement security measures at the server or proxy level rather than solely in application code. `TRUE` means yes, do that. Examples: using a reverse proxy (like Traefik, which they have) to enforce some headers (CSP, etc.), or the web server to handle SSL and HSTS, etc., instead of relying on app code inside Django. It might also refer to using OS-level security config (like file permissions, AppArmor, etc.) rather than just trusting code logic.\
Why Useful: Defense in depth and performance: Proxy or server-level enforcement is often harder to bypass and can handle things uniformly (for example, blocking malicious requests before they hit the app). It also frees the app from having to implement everything (e.g., Traefik can handle SSL redirect and HSTS injection, which is less overhead for Django). Setting this ensures the AI configures some settings in Traefik or other server config. Possibly "if possible" acknowledges some things must be in app code, but to offload what can be.\
Extra setting examples: If set false, they'd rely on the application for everything, but here they want a layered approach. They may incorporate security config in multiple places (traefik config, django settings).

PARADIGM | ZERO_TRUST; LEAST_PRIVILEGE; DEFENSE_IN_DEPTH; SECURE_BY_DEFAULT\
Interpretation: These are the core security philosophies guiding development:

-   Zero Trust: Assume no part of the system (user, network, service) is inherently trustworthy; always verify credentials and authenticity. Essentially, do not have a wide-open internal trust zone either.

-   Least Privilege: Give each user, process, or component the minimum access/permissions needed to perform its function and nothing more. E.g., if a service doesn't need DB write access, don't give it. Or a user in the app should only see their data (RLS fosters this).

-   Defense in Depth: Layer multiple security controls so that if one fails, others still protect the system. E.g., validate input in front-end and back-end, plus use DB constraints, etc. Or firewall plus app auth.

-   Secure by Default: Set defaults to the most secure settings, requiring intentional action to make something less secure if necessary. E.g., new user accounts might have minimal access until configured, or features off unless needed (like optional features are off by default, opt-in). Or shipping config with things like debug off, etc.

Why Useful: These paradigms ensure the team's mindset is always security-first. By listing them, the AI should consider them in every decision. For example, Zero Trust: verify user tokens on every request; with microservices, don't assume internal calls are safe, etc. Least privilege: design role scopes carefully, ensure DB user for the app has limited rights (maybe no drop tables). Defense in depth: do input validation both client and server side. Secure by default: perhaps ensure default config files (like default settings) are locked down (like by default no admin interface or default credentials). It's basically a checklist to measure designs against.\
Extra setting examples: Could include things like "Fail Securely" (fail closed rather than open), but those four cover a lot.

CSP_ENFORCED | TRUE\
Interpretation: Content Security Policy will be enforced. This means they'll set a CSP header in responses that whitelists sources of scripts, styles, etc., to mitigate XSS and injection of rogue scripts. True means definitely do this.\
Why Useful: CSP is a powerful web security layer that can prevent execution of malicious scripts even if injected. The AI will ensure to configure an appropriate CSP (like only allow scripts from their own domain and perhaps known CDNs for things like Stripe or analytics, disallow inline scripts, etc.). It might be easier to do at proxy level (Traefik can inject headers or serve the static pages with headers). Ensuring CSP is enforced by default adds an extra barrier against XSS.\
Extra setting examples: If false, they'd skip it, but they want it. Possibly they might set it in Django middleware or via Traefik config.

CSP_ALLOW_LIST | ENV_DRIVEN\
Interpretation: The allowed sources for CSP (the whitelist) will be driven by environment config. That implies they won't hardcode the domains in code. Instead, depending on environment (dev vs prod), they might allow different origins (like in dev allow localhost:3000 for hot reloading, in prod only allow <REDACTED_FOR_IP>.io). By making it env-driven, they can easily adjust without code changes.\
Why Useful: Flexibility and security: you can tighten CSP in production but loosen in dev if needed. For instance, in development, one might allow eval for certain tools or local IPs, but not in prod. Or incorporate environment-specific hostnames. This prevents mistakes of leaving a dev open CSP in prod because you can separate them. The AI should implement reading allowed origins from environment variables or config and apply them to CSP header.\
Extra setting examples: They could have a static list but this is better.

HSTS | TRUE\
Interpretation: HTTP Strict Transport Security is enabled. This header tells browsers to only use HTTPS for the domain and subdomains for a certain period. True means they will send the HSTS header (likely with a long duration and include subdomains).\
Why Useful: It prevents man-in-the-middle by ensuring that if someone tries to load http://<REDACTED_FOR_IP>.io, the browser will automatically switch to https (after the first visit sets HSTS). It also disallows click-through for invalid certs. It's a best practice for any site that uses HTTPS. The AI will set this, likely in Traefik or server config, to a high max-age (like 6 months or a year).\
Extra setting examples: If a site needed to be accessible via http (not recommended), they'd set false. But here definitely true.

SSL_REDIRECT | TRUE\
Interpretation: The server (or proxy) will redirect all HTTP traffic to HTTPS. True means they will implement a redirect so that any non-secure request is sent to the secure URL. This pairs with HSTS for security.\
Why Useful: Guarantee all communications are encrypted. If a user accidentally goes to http or a link is out-of-date, they'll be put on https automatically. The AI will configure Traefik or Django to enforce this (Django has SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT setting if using it, or Traefik can do a redirect). It's especially important before HSTS takes effect (first visit).\
Extra setting examples: Only would be false in dev maybe or if behind a proxy that already does it. Possibly in dev environment they'd skip it to allow local http usage, but in prod definitely on.

REFERRER_POLICY | STRICT\
Interpretation: The site will use a strict Referrer Policy. Likely they mean something like `strict-origin-when-cross-origin` or `same-origin` or `no-referrer` (strict could refer to not leaking full URLs). Possibly they intend the strictest viable: e.g., `no-referrer` which means no referrer header sent at all to other domains, or `strict-origin` which sends only the origin for same-site, nothing cross-site. Without the exact header value, I'd guess "STRICT" implies not sending referrers to external sites (to avoid leaking user info or internal paths).\
Why Useful: This protects user privacy (some URLs may contain sensitive data or simply they don't want other sites seeing they came from a <REDACTED_FOR_IP> app if maybe that's a privacy concern). Also it can help mitigate some CSRF and info leak scenarios by not exposing internal structure. The AI will thus set a Referrer-Policy header accordingly.\
Extra setting examples: They could specify exactly, but leaving it as "STRICT" suggests they want the most privacy-preserving that still allows function. Many use `strict-origin-when-cross-origin` as a balanced default these days.

RLS_ENFORCED | TRUE\
Interpretation: As previously indicated, Row-Level Security is enforced at the database level. True means they will actively set up RLS policies and ensure they are in effect for data segregation. In Postgres, you can turn on RLS per table and add policies. This being in security reaffirms commitment to multi-tenancy isolation.\
Why Useful: Even if the app had a bug that forgot an org filter, RLS would block unauthorized data. It's a second line of defense (defense in depth principle). The AI when creating tables will add `ALTER TABLE ... ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY` and `CREATE POLICY ...` statements via migrations. Also ensure that queries run under a DB role or session context that triggers the correct filter. Possibly using the `current_setting('rls.organization_id') = org_id` approach or simply user-specific roles. It's advanced but strongly secures data.\
Extra setting examples: If false, they'd rely solely on app logic for multi-tenancy, which can be error-prone. They specifically want it, which is good.

SECURITY_AUDIT_TOOL | SNYK\
Interpretation: This repeats that they are using Snyk as the security audit tool. Likely they mention it here again to emphasize it's part of security process, not just context info. It means an audit (like the /audit command or CI runs) will run Snyk to check for vulnerabilities.\
Why Useful: Reinforces that dependency and known vulnerability scanning is mandatory. The AI will ensure Snyk is integrated (maybe via a GitHub Action or CLI invocation in CI). They might also use it for container scanning if any. It's one layer of defense. Already addressed above.

CODE_QUALITY_TOOLS | RUFF; ESLINT; VITEST; JS**DO**M; INHOUSE_TESTS\
Interpretation: Building on earlier code quality tools, they also list JS**DO**M and in-house tests now:

-   JS**DO**M: a JavaScript **DO**M emulation environment often used for running front-end tests in Node (Vitest likely uses JS**DO**M to simulate a browser so that React components and **DO**M manipulation can be tested without a real browser). By listing it, they ensure it's part of dev dependencies and to be used in tests.

-   In-house tests: they have their own custom tests, possibly integration or scenario tests not covered by unit tests. This might refer to tests they've written that don't fall under Vitest or standard unit tests (maybe Python tests for backend, or some custom automated QA scripts). Could also hint at something like Cypress (for end-to-end) but not mentioned explicitly; "inhouse" suggests they mean any tests they wrote specifically that might not be covered by standard frameworks (or maybe they have a test harness to simulate usage?).

Why Useful: It's making sure all facets of code quality are covered: static analysis (Ruff, ESLint), unit tests (Vitest for front, presumably Django's test framework for back implied), and possibly additional integration tests. JS**DO**M ensures their front-end tests have a realistic environment for **DO**M. "Inhouse tests" might be to catch domain-specific or full flow issues beyond what typical unit tests would cover. The AI should maintain and run these. If they write new features, they might add integration tests in whatever system "inhouse tests" refer to (maybe a separate test directory or script).\
Extra setting examples: Possibly they would add `pytest` or similar, but not listed, presumably their own tests cover backend. Or they assume Django's test runner (which uses unittest or pytest, but could have mentioned).

SOURCE_MAPS | FALSE\
Interpretation: In production, they will not serve or keep source maps for front-end code. Source maps help in debugging by mapping minified code back to original, but they can also expose source code to end-users if accessible. `FALSE` means when building for production, source maps should be disabled or not deployed.\
Why Useful: This prevents someone from reconstructing the original React source, which might contain sensitive logic or at least intellectual property. It also saves a bit of bandwidth. Downside is debugging production issues is harder, but they accept that for security. The AI will configure the build (with Vite) to not generate or to exclude source maps on deploy.\
Extra setting examples: Could be `TRUE` if they were okay exposing code or if it's open source anyway. But since the product may be closed source SaaS, better to hide it.

SANITIZE_UPLOADS | TRUE\
Interpretation: Any user-uploaded files will be sanitized. That could mean various things: for documents, remove macros or embedded scripts; for images, strip metadata and ensure it's a valid image; for PDFs, perhaps flatten or sanitize to remove JavaScript (PDFs can have embedded scripts or links), ensure they are not malicious. It might also mean virus scanning. But at least making sure uploads can't carry an exploit (like an SVG with embedded script, or an HTML pretending to be a .doc).\
Why Useful: Users may upload files either to provide content or to attach to <REDACTED_FOR_IP>, etc. Sanitizing protects both the platform (e.g., if someone uploads a malicious file intending to target an admin) and other users who might download those files (if collaboration means sharing files). It also helps with privacy (strip EXIF metadata from images, etc.). The AI should integrate some scanning library or use OS tools (like ClamAV for viruses, or a library for PDF sanitization). Or a simpler approach: only accept certain file types and possibly convert them to a safe format (like if a user uploads .docx, they might convert to PDF or text server-side, which inherently sanitizes by re-rendering content).\
Extra setting examples: If false, they'd trust users which is risky. There might be degrees, but True means do it. They might implement content scanning pipeline in Celery tasks.

SANITIZE_INPUTS | TRUE\
Interpretation: All user inputs (text fields, etc.) will be sanitized to prevent things like XSS or injection. E.g., stripping or encoding HTML tags in text, removing SQL wildcards if any direct SQL usage (though Django ORM usually safe), etc. Also perhaps normalizing strings to avoid hidden characters attacks. This is a typical security measure for any user-provided text.\
Why Useful: It stops cross-site scripting if some text might get rendered as HTML (like maybe the <REDACTED_FOR_IP> could be output in a preview; ensure any user-supplied text is escaped so they can't, for example, put `<script>` in an answer and then have the preview run it). It also can unify text format and remove known dangerous patterns. The AI will ensure to incorporate either built-in frameworks (Django has autoescaping by default in templates, but since React is used, React escapes content by default in rendering, except for anything deliberately set as HTML). If they allow some rich text (not indicated), they'd need to sanitize that specifically. In general, True means be paranoid: do not trust input.\
Extra setting examples: Could specify which technique (like use OWASP ESAPI or similar). But the devs just need to follow best practices (like always use parameterized queries, which Django ORM does, and always output with escaping in React, which is default unless using dangerouslySetInnerHTML). The AI might incorporate a library for sanitizing HTML if they allow user to input something like HTML content (but likely not needed if all inputs are plain text).

RATE_LIMITING | TRUE\
Interpretation: The application (or possibly proxy) will implement rate limiting to prevent abuse (too many requests in a short time, etc.). True means set up limits like how many requests per minute per IP or per user, etc.\
Why Useful: Protects against denial-of-service and brute force attempts (like trying many login attempts, or spamming the AI endpoints). It also helps manage costs on the AI side by not letting one user spam hundreds of completions. The AI should integrate a rate-limit mechanism. Possibly at the proxy (Traefik has some rate limit middleware) or in Django (there are libraries like dj-throttle or use of cache to count). They need to be careful to allow legitimate usage but block abuse.\
Extra setting examples: Could choose to skip in an internal app, but since this might be public SaaS, definitely needed.

REVERSE_PROXY | ENABLED\
Interpretation: A reverse proxy (like Traefik, as indicated later, or Nginx) is enabled in front of the application. This confirms the architecture where the proxy handles incoming traffic, SSL, routing to the web app or static files, etc.\
Why Useful: Reverse proxies improve security and manageability (they can do load balancing, hide internal network, handle TLS, etc.). The AI will consider that certain headers (like X-Forwarded-For) need to be handled due to proxy, and that some security measures might be implemented at the proxy (like earlier said CSP and HSTS could be done there). It's also relevant for making web sockets or other services possible under one domain.\
Extra setting examples: If disabled, the app would be directly exposed, which they aren't doing. They explicitly mention Traefik later as the proxy.

AUTH_STRATEGY | OAUTH_ONLY\
Interpretation: The authentication strategy for user accounts is OAuth only, meaning users will log in via external OAuth providers (like Google, GitHub, etc.) and not with local username/password. That aligns with the settings in [AUTH] below that said local passwords false. So sign-up and login are done through Google/GitHub/Facebook sign-in.\
Why Useful: It simplifies account security (no password storage to worry about, and also easier onboarding for users since they just use an existing account). It's also somewhat more secure since it offloads authentication to trusted providers (and they can have 2FA etc.). The AI will thus implement only OAuth flows in the front-end (likely using something like OAuth2 Authorization Code with PKCE to the Django server which uses social auth libs). The presence of this in security reminds to ensure it's done properly (validate OAuth responses, etc.).\
Extra setting examples: If they allowed local, they'd perhaps say `OAUTH_PREFERRED` or something, but they've locked it to only OAuth.

MINIFY | TRUE\
Interpretation: Static assets (JS/CSS) will be minified for production. True means yes, they will compress and remove whitespace, etc., to reduce load size. Vite by default does this on production build.\
Why Useful: Smaller files, faster loads, also slightly obsfuscates code (though not the main reason, security, but doesn't hurt). The AI will ensure that build is run in production mode which minifies. It's standard.\
Extra setting examples: If false, they'd serve raw code, which is unusual for prod.

TREE_SHAKE | TRUE\
Interpretation: The build process will perform tree shaking, meaning unused code (from libraries or components not imported) will be removed from the final bundle. Vite/Webpack does this for ES6 modules automatically when set properly. True means ensure it's happening (like don't do something to prevent it).\
Why Useful: Keeps the front-end bundle lean by excluding things not needed. It's important with large libraries to not include all of it if only a part is used. The AI should avoid coding patterns that defeat tree shaking (like dynamic requires in ways that bundler can't analyze, though in TS/ES6 it's mostly fine).\
Extra setting examples: If false, they'd carry dead code, which is not desired.

REMOVE_DEBUGGERS | TRUE\
Interpretation: They will ensure to strip out any `debugger` statements (and likely console logs as well, though console logs not explicitly mentioned but often done together) from production code. True means do it as part of build pipeline.\
Why Useful: `debugger;` if left in code can halt execution if devtools open. Also it's messy. There are Babel/terser options to remove those. Console logs could leak info too, maybe they also plan to remove them. The AI will check for and not leave any stray debug calls. Possibly an ESLint rule already catches this or the build minifier does it.\
Extra setting examples: Could mention console specifically, but it's implied.

API_KEY_HANDLING | ENV_DRIVEN\
Interpretation: All API keys (for third-party services, like OpenAI, Stripe secret, etc.) will be provided via environment variables or a secret management, not hard-coded. `ENV_DRIVEN` means the app expects these keys to be in environment settings at runtime (or in a secrets manager that injects env vars). The code should fetch them from env (like using os.environ or settings).\
Why Useful: Keeps secrets out of code and repository. Easier to rotate or change per environment (dev vs prod keys). The AI will ensure no keys are accidentally logged or stored, and that documentation instructs setting appropriate env values.\
Extra setting examples: If they had a separate config file for keys, they'd mention it, but env is typical for 12-factor apps.

DATABASE_URL | ENV_DRIVEN\
Interpretation: The database connection URL/credentials will also come from environment (like the standard DATABASE_URL env var). This means not storing DB password or host in code, and easily configurable for dev vs production.\
Why Useful: This decouples config from code, enabling easier deployment changes and better security (no plain creds in code). The AI will use something like `os.environ["DATABASE_URL"]` possibly with Django's `dj_database_url` to configure the DB connection.\
Extra setting examples: Usually done anyway, but explicitly stating it ensures no one writes a connection string directly.

SECRETS_MANAGEMENT | ENV_VARS_INJECTED_VIA_SECRETS_MANAGER\
Interpretation: They plan to use a Secrets Manager (maybe AWS Secrets Manager, Hashicorp Vault, or Docker Swarm secrets, etc.) which will inject the secret values as environment variables. This is more of deployment detail: rather than manually setting env vars or storing in .env files, they will store secrets in a central manager and the deployment platform will populate env at runtime.\
Why Useful: It's more secure and manageable at scale (no plaintext secrets in config files or CI logs; the secrets manager handles encryption at rest and controlled access). For the AI, this means assume at runtime the needed env vars are present and possibly not visible in code or logs (so be careful not to output them). It might affect how one deploys (like for GitHub Actions, might need to fetch secrets, etc.). It's a note mostly for ops.\
Extra setting examples: Could have been just static env or config files, but they want best practice with a secrets manager.

ON_SNYK_FALSE_POSITIVE | ALERT_USER; ADD_IGNORE_CONFIG_FOR_ISSUE\
Interpretation: If Snyk flags an issue that the team assesses as a false positive (not an actual vulnerability for their context or a mis-detection), they will: Alert the user (i.e., inform the team or responsible person that Snyk reported something but it's believed to be a false positive), and Add an ignore configuration for that specific issue so that Snyk won't keep flagging it in future scans or CI runs. Possibly this means updating a snyk policy file or using Snyk commands to ignore the CVE ID.\
Why Useful: This ensures the CI/CD pipeline isn't blocked by known false alarms, while still documenting them. By alerting user (maybe via an issue or Slack), they keep track that they've consciously ignored something, which is good for accountability. And ignoring in config means smoother future runs. They do, however, not ignore without making someone aware, which is good governance.\
Extra setting examples: They could choose to always fail build on any Snyk finding (even false, requiring manual override each time), but that slows development. By ignoring false ones in config, they streamline it after initial review.

The [AUTH] section next details specifics about account management with OAuth only, which we've partially gleaned, but let's outline it.

[AUTH] -- Critical Authentication Settings
-----------------------------------------

*This section configures how user accounts and authentication are handled, emphasizing OAuth.*

LOCAL_REGISTRATION | OAUTH_ONLY\
Interpretation: Users can only register via OAuth providers, not by creating a username/password on this platform. "Local registration" meaning signing up directly is not allowed, except via an OAuth flow. So there will be no "sign up with email & password" form.\
Why Useful: This reduces complexity and risk (no password storage). The platform will rely on Google/GitHub/Facebook to vet the identity. The AI will implement sign up flows that basically just redirect to those providers and then create an account upon callback. Possibly "local registration: OAUTH_ONLY" means they consider the creation of a local user record as binding to an OAuth account, but not an independent credential.\
Extra setting examples: Could have allowed both local and OAuth (most sites do), but perhaps due to audience (nonprofits, easier to click Google login than remember another password) and security, they restrict to OAuth.

LOCAL_LOGIN | OAUTH_ONLY\
Interpretation: Similarly, logging in is only possible via OAuth. So users will always click "Login with Google/GitHub/FB" rather than entering a password on <REDACTED_FOR_IP>. The platform will likely use JWTs for session (given "SESSION_MANAGER: JWT"). So no local login form.\
Why Useful: Uniform login method, one less surface for attacks (no brute forcing credentials on <REDACTED_FOR_IP>.io). Also easier user experience (especially if you're targeting not super tech-savvy, it's easier to delegate auth). This also means if someone inadvertently ended up with an account not linked to OAuth, they'd have no way to log in, but given registration is OAuth only, that situation shouldn't occur.\
Extra setting examples: Standard setups might allow email/password as fallback if someone doesn't have social accounts, but they chose not to manage that complexity.

OAUTH_PROVIDERS | GOOGLE; GITHUB; FACEBOOK\
Interpretation: The three external OAuth providers they will support are Google, GitHub, and Facebook. Users can authenticate via any of these. Google covers probably the majority of users (many have Google accounts), GitHub covers tech-savvy (maybe if the project appeals to open-source or dev audience too, but also many general tech users have GitHub nowadays), and Facebook might cover more NGO or community folks who use FB accounts. Notably missing: LinkedIn (could have been relevant for professional context, but maybe not needed), or Microsoft (less likely needed). But these three are a good mix.\
Why Useful: It defines which OAuth flows to implement (client IDs, secrets for each, etc.). The AI or dev will set up OAuth apps on these platforms and integrate via a library (like allauth or python-social-auth for Django). It also means you might present three buttons on login. It covers a broad user base.\
Extra setting examples: Could add LinkedIn, or ORCID for researchers (less common, maybe not needed), but they might keep it simple for now.

OAUTH_REDIRECT_URI | ENV_DRIVEN\
Interpretation: The OAuth redirect URI (the callback URL where providers send auth response) is configured via environment variables. Typically, for each provider, you must specify allowed redirect URIs in their app config, and also your app needs to know its own domain to form the callback link. By making it env-driven, they can set different URIs in dev vs prod (like `http://localhost:8000/callback` vs `https://<REDACTED_FOR_IP>.io/callback`). The code will likely read something like `OAUTH_REDIRECT_BASE_URL`from env and build provider-specific callback paths from it.\
Why Useful: Flexibility in different deployments, and not hardcoding domains. This also ties to security because if you accidentally had a wrong redirect, login might fail or be exploitable. It's good to manage it centrally. The AI will ensure to use env config for any absolute URLs needed for OAuth flow.\
Extra setting examples: Could derive from request, but better to explicitly set to avoid issues behind proxies, etc.

SESSION_IDLE_TIMEOUT | 30_MINUTES\
Interpretation: If a user is idle for 30 minutes, their session will expire. "Idle" likely means no requests or activity from the user for that duration (they might implement via a rolling JWT expiration or server session expiry). This is a security measure to log out inactive users.\
Why Useful: It reduces risk if someone leaves the app open on a shared computer or their token gets stolen (the token would expire soon if not active). 30 minutes is a common default (maybe a bit short for some, but given the nature of writing content, a user might be actively typing which presumably counts as activity if it triggers saves or so. If they go to lunch, they'd have to re-login). It aligns with their secure stance. The AI will configure the JWT expiry accordingly or use a sliding expiration mechanism. Possibly they will have refresh tokens to allow a longer login without re-OAuth if user is active. But if truly idle for 30, require re-auth.\
Extra setting examples: Could have opted for longer (some apps do hours or "remember me" options). But they want security prioritized.

SESSION_MANAGER | JWT\
Interpretation: They will use JSON Web Tokens for session management instead of server-side sessions or cookies alone. JWT suggests stateless auth: when a user logs in via OAuth, the server issues a JWT that encodes user info and maybe an expiry, and the front-end stores it (likely in memory or maybe a cookie if careful, but often in memory or localStorage if allowed, though localStorage has XSS risk; maybe cookie with HttpOnly if possible). Then each request includes the JWT (maybe as Authorization header). This is typical for SPAs.\
Why Useful: JWTs allow the front-end to directly call the API with an auth header, which fits the React front-end calling Django backend scenario. They are stateless, so scaling is easier (no sticky sessions needed). They can also embed claims (like roles, or org id) so the backend can enforce things (though with RLS, they'd also set context per token). The AI will likely use something like django-rest-framework-simplejwt or custom JWT handling.\
Extra setting examples: Could have used session cookies with the Django session framework, but that's trickier to coordinate with React on a different domain or port (CORS, etc.). JWT is a good call.

BIND_TO_LOCAL_ACCOUNT | TRUE\
Interpretation: Even though auth is via OAuth, they will create a local user account in their database and bind the OAuth identity to it. True means yes, do create a local user entry (with things like email, name, etc.), linked to the OAuth provider info. This way, the user exists in their system separate from the provider.\
Why Useful: This allows storing user-specific data (like their role in an org, preferences, usage metrics) in the app's DB keyed by user. Also, it allows linking multiple OAuth methods to one user (like same user can connect Google and GitHub and treat as one account, which their later settings cover). Without a local account, they'd have to rely on provider ID only, which is limiting for internal references. So the AI will implement something like: on OAuth callback, find or create a User record with that email and attach the provider details (like store OAuth UID, token if needed for reauth or avatar etc.).\
Extra setting examples: It's how most apps do it. Alternatively, some apps do not store local at all and use JWT issued by provider directly for trust (for enterprise stuff), but here they need local records.

LOCAL_ACCOUNT_UNIQUE_IDENTIFIER | PRIMARY_EMAIL\
Interpretation: The uniqueness of user accounts is determined by the primary email address. This suggests that if two OAuth providers return the same email, they should correspond to the same user (if `OAUTH_SAME_EMAIL_BIND_TO_EXISTING` is true as given). They won't allow two different local users with the same email. The primary email likely is one of the emails from the OAuth provider (all these providers give an email after consent; the user might have multiple emails on an account though). They will treat that email as the key.\
Why Useful: Email is a stable identity across providers. It helps merging accounts from different providers if user chooses (like log in with Google vs GitHub both give same email -> treat as one account). It also helps contacting the user or sending notifications. They don't have usernames or userIDs manually assigned, using email works well. The AI must ensure email uniqueness is enforced in the User model (maybe set unique=True on email field or handle merges).\
Extra setting examples: If they allowed multiple accounts with same email (some apps do if they have username login, but they don't want that).

OAUTH_SAME_EMAIL_BIND_TO_EXISTING | TRUE\
Interpretation: If a user signs in with an OAuth provider and that provider returns an email that matches an existing account's primary email, then the new login will be bound to the existing account rather than creating a duplicate. True means do this auto-binding. For example, user made an account with Google (email x), later tries logging in with GitHub which also has email x -> the system logs them into the same account.\
Why Useful: It prevents duplicate accounts, as long as the email is a reliable linking key. It's user-friendly (they might not even realize, it just logs them in). It requires that the email from provider is verified (Google and GitHub usually only provide if verified). There is a slight risk if someone used one person's email to sign up on another, but since OAuth gives only your own verified email, it's fine. The AI will implement logic to check email match after OAuth login and merge accounts if needed. Possibly using a library where this is a setting.\
Extra setting examples: If false, they'd create separate accounts for each provider even if email same, which could cause confusion and fragmentation of user data.

OAUTH_ALLOW_SECONDARY_EMAIL | TRUE\
Interpretation: Some OAuth providers (like GitHub) can provide a list of emails (primary and secondary emails associated with the account). This setting likely means they will accept and store secondary emails from the provider. Or allow linking a secondary email later. True implies the account can have more than one email associated (with one marked primary). Possibly they plan to let the user see/add secondary emails via linking another OAuth provider or via the provider's info.\
Why Useful: People often have multiple emails. If a user's GitHub has their work and personal email, one might be primary, but they might want both recognized. Also, if someone invites a user via a different email than their OAuth primary, having secondary helps match that. The AI might gather all verified emails from provider and store them (e.g., in a separate model or as list in user profile). It can help the scenario of someone trying to join an org via an email invite that matches their secondary.\
Extra setting examples: Could restrict to primary only (false), but true is more flexible.

OAUTH_ALLOW_SECONDARY_EMAIL_USED_BY_ANOTHER_ACCOUNT | FALSE\
Interpretation: If an email is already associated with one user (even as a secondary), it cannot be used as a secondary for another user. False means do NOT allow an email address to appear in two different user accounts. This prevents any overlap. Essentially, all emails in the system must be unique across the entire user base.\
Why Useful: To avoid confusion or security holes. If not enforced, you could have scenarios like: User A's secondary email is something that is primary for User B (maybe one user has multiple accounts and tries to merge?), that would conflict. So they disallow any email attaching if it's in use. They might have to handle cases where someone attempts to link an email already used: likely reject and alert to conflict. This ensures one person per email.\
Extra setting examples: If true, they would allow some messy scenarios, so false is right.

ALLOW_OAUTH_ACCOUNT_UNBIND | TRUE\
Interpretation: The user is allowed to unbind (disconnect) an OAuth provider from their account. True means in the UI, a user can remove, say, their GitHub link as long as they have at least one other method left (they cover that next). If a user no longer wants to use Facebook to login, they can disconnect it and maybe later connect a different one or just use Google.\
Why Useful: It gives users control, which is good for privacy and account management (e.g., if they quit Facebook, they might want to remove that link). It also ensures accounts aren't irrevocably tied to a service the user might lose (like if they lose access to a particular OAuth account, they could still log in via another if they set it up before, or unbind a compromised one). The AI should implement the ability to remove a provider from user's account (except the last one if min providers is 1 as below). Possibly using something like django-allauth, they can remove social accounts.\
Extra setting examples: Could be false to lock accounts to initial provider to reduce support issues, but that's not user-friendly.

MINIMUM_BOUND_OAUTH_PROVIDERS | 1\
Interpretation: Each user account must have at least one OAuth provider linked at any time. If they attempt to remove the only one, presumably the system will prevent it. So a user cannot have zero login methods.\
Why Useful: Otherwise they'd lock themselves out. By forcing at least one, it ensures the account is accessible. The AI will enforce this rule when user tries to unbind a provider (if they have two, they can remove one; if they have one, they must add another first before removing the first, or just can't remove the last). It's a safety measure aligning with allow_unbind above.\
Extra setting examples: If they allowed password login, min could be 0 since they could still login via password, but here OAuth only, so need at least 1.

LOCAL_PASSWORDS | FALSE\
Interpretation: They do not permit local password auth. False means the system will not allow setting or using a password for login. (Likely they won't even have that column or if they use Django's user model, they might leave password field blank/unused). If some user tries to do a password reset or something, they might disable that mechanism. It also indicates any local login endpoints are turned off.\
Why Useful: It simplifies security (no password storage or hashing to manage) and ensures everyone goes through OAuth, which often has better security (like 2FA). The AI should ensure features like "forgot password" or "change password" are hidden/disabled. Possibly they might still create a random password to satisfy Django's user model requirement but never use it.\
Extra setting examples: We know they want OAuth only, so this is consistent.

USER_MAY_DELETE_ACCOUNT | TRUE\
Interpretation: Users have the ability to delete their own account if they want. True means they likely will provide a UI option to "Delete My Account," which would presumably remove personal data according to policies. They mention later how deletion works (grace period etc.). It's an important user right especially with privacy laws.\
Why Useful: Empowering users to leave fosters trust and also complies with things like GDPR's right to erasure. The AI will implement an account deletion flow (maybe immediate anonymization or a 7-day pending deletion as mentioned, with warnings). It also means handling consequences (like if they were the only admin of an org, what happens - maybe orphaned org deletion rule covers that).\
Extra setting examples: Some services disallow user deletion or make you contact support, but they choose yes to be user-friendly and legally safe.

USER_MAY_CHANGE_PRIMARY_EMAIL | TRUE\
Interpretation: Users can change which email is their primary one on the account. Since we allow multiple emails, one is marked primary (the unique identifier basically). True means they'll provide a way to promote a secondary email to be the primary (maybe in settings user chooses "make this my main email"). This could be needed if, say, a user changes jobs and wants their new email as primary contact.\
Why Useful: Allows users to maintain their account as their contact info changes. It might also trigger sending verification to the new email etc. The AI should ensure that switching primary doesn't violate uniqueness (the new one isn't used elsewhere except maybe already as secondary on this account). Also, if primary changes, that might be how invites or notifications get directed. It's part of account management flexibility.\
Extra setting examples: If false, whatever email they started with stays primary (less flexible). True is more user-centric.

USER_MAY_ADD_SECONDARY_EMAILS | OAUTH_ONLY\
Interpretation: Users can add additional emails to their account, but only via OAuth linking. That is, they cannot just type an email and verify it manually; they must connect another OAuth provider that uses that email. "OAUTH_ONLY" suggests the only way to add a secondary email is by linking an account that has that email as its verified email. They won't have a mechanism to just manually add an email address and send a confirmation link.\
Why Useful: It ensures that any email on the account has been verified by an OAuth provider, hence belongs to the user. This prevents someone adding an email that isn't theirs (except by creating a dummy OAuth account for it, which is at least some friction and requires access to that email anyway). It's simpler implementation too, piggybacking on OAuth verification. The AI will implement secondary email addition by linking new provider accounts. If a user wants to add a personal email, they'd use "Login with Facebook (with personal email)" to attach it, for example. They won't implement an independent email verification system.\
Extra setting examples: They could have allowed adding email via a code/email verification process, but that duplicates what OAuth does and is extra dev work. This approach is secure and streamlined given they already require OAuth.

Now [PRIVACY] is crucial; let's parse those.

[PRIVACY] -- Critical User Privacy Policies
------------------------------------------

*This section outlines how the application will handle user data, focusing on minimization, transparency, and user rights.*

COOKIES | FEWEST_POSSIBLE\
Interpretation: The application will use as few cookies as absolutely necessary. Possibly only one for session (if using JWT in cookie) or maybe none if JWT is in local storage (but local storage isn't recommended for security, HttpOnly cookie is safer, albeit CSRF risk). "Fewest possible" means they will not add any tracking or unnecessary cookies (e.g., no third-party cookies for tracking, etc., and maybe not even persistent cookies if they can avoid it).\
Why Useful: Minimizing cookies is better for privacy (less data on client, less tracking). Also easier to manage for cookie consent laws (maybe if they only use an essential cookie for session, they might not need a cookie banner depending on jurisdiction). The AI will ensure to not introduce cookies for trivial things and possibly to use other storage for ephemeral data. If they use Umami, note: Umami can be configured cookieless or with a minimal cookie; likely they'll do cookieless mode. They might have one cookie for JWT or use Authorization header instead. But even JWT, if stored in a cookie, is one cookie.\
Extra setting examples: Could say "none if possible", but since login likely requires a token either in cookie or localstore, at least one item.

PRIVACY_POLICY | FULL_TRANSPARENCY\
Interpretation: The Privacy Policy will be written and practiced with full transparency. That means it will clearly inform users of all data usage in a straightforward way, no hiding behind legalese or burying details. They likely commit to telling exactly what data is collected, how it's used, etc.\
Why Useful: Transparency builds trust and meets legal requirements (GDPR, etc.). The AI should ensure the privacy policy document (likely to be written) lists all relevant items like analytics data collected, retention times, AI usage (like if user data is used to train models or not, probably not?). Full transparency suggests they won't do sneaky data uses that aren't communicated. It's also tied to the "friendly tone" below.\
Extra setting examples: Some policies are minimal to cover legal but might not highlight all usage; here they want to go beyond minimal.

PRIVACY_POLICY_TONE | FRIENDLY; NON-LEGALISTIC; CONVERSATIONAL\
Interpretation: The tone/style of the privacy policy should be friendly, not full of legal jargon, and written in a conversational manner that an average user can understand. This likely means they'll produce a human-readable summary or the entire doc in plain English, maybe with a touch of approachable language. Possibly similar to how some companies (like Mozilla or basecamp) write plain-language policies. They want it to feel like the company is open and user-aligned, not trying to confuse.\
Why Useful: Users often skip or misunderstand privacy policies because they're dense. By making it conversational, users might actually read it and trust the service more. It also aligns with their audience (nonprofits, researchers) who may not have legal teams to parse it, so clarity is key. The AI might even help generate or refine that document with this tone in mind.\
Extra setting examples: Could be formal if they wanted, but they specifically want a friendly vibe.

USER_RIGHTS | DATA_VIEW_IN_BROWSER; DATA_EXPORT; DATA_DELETION\
Interpretation: They acknowledge key user rights:

-   Right to view their data in the browser: presumably some account section where users can see all data the system has about them (like profile info, content they've provided, maybe usage logs if requested?).

-   Right to export their data: the user can download their data (like <REDACTED_FOR_IP> they've written, profile info, etc.) likely in a standard format (maybe a JSON or an archive of their <REDACTED_FOR_IP>).

-   Right to deletion: user can have their personal data deleted (account deletion triggers removal of personal info).\
    These align with GDPR rights of access, portability, and erasure.

Why Useful: It's user-centric and legally important. The AI will ensure features to support these: maybe an export function to get all <REDACTED_FOR_IP> in one zip or such; a profile view that displays stored data; and deletion workflow as we saw. It shows compliance with common privacy principles.\
Extra setting examples: Possibly also "Right to correct data" (they might allow editing profile info which covers that, not explicitly stated but likely allowed), or "Right to object to processing" (they partly cover analytics opt-out below). But the main ones are covered.

EXERCISE_RIGHTS | EASY_VIA_UI\
Interpretation: The method for users to exercise the above rights is easy and through the user interfaceitself (not by emailing support or hunting down a process). For example, an account settings page with buttons for "Download your data", "Delete account", "View your data". They want no friction.\
Why Useful: Making it easy means they are confident in their privacy stance (not trying to hide these options). It also ensures compliance since if it's easy, there's no excuse for not honoring requests quickly. The AI will design the UI accordingly (account management page with these options).\
Extra setting examples: If they were shadier they'd bury these behind contacting support or forms; they explicitly avoid that.

DATA_RETENTION | USER_CONTROLLED; MINIMIZE_DEFAULT; ESSENTIAL_ONLY\
Interpretation: The strategy for data retention is:

-   User Controlled: The user should have control over how long their data is retained (within some bounds perhaps). For example, user can delete things when they want, or maybe set retention preferences.

-   Minimize Default: By default, the system keeps data for the shortest time necessary. They won't hold onto data indefinitely just because. Only essential data is kept by default if the user doesn't intervene.

-   Essential Only: They will not retain data that isn't essential to the service functioning. This implies no hoarding of extra info for undefined future use; if it's not needed, it's not kept. Possibly they won't keep logs with personal info longer than needed for debugging, etc.

Why Useful: This is a strong privacy approach. It means, for instance, if a <REDACTED_FOR_IP> is done and maybe after some period they might remove it unless user wants it saved. Or they won't keep user activity logs beyond what's needed for metrics then aggregate or delete them. User controlled suggests maybe in settings a user can choose retention times or to auto-delete content after a project finishes. The AI might have to implement such features (like auto-delete old data or an archive with time limit, which indeed they mention archives for 42 days). Minimizing by default means if user does nothing, data might auto-expire eventually (except what's essential like billing records legally required, etc.).\
Extra setting examples: It's quite user-first. They might have to balance some things (like a user might want them to keep <REDACTED_FOR_IP> until deleted manually; hopefully they won't surprise-delete something because "minimize by default" could conflict with user expectation to keep their work as long as they have the account). But I think they mean not collecting extra stuff.

DATA_RETENTION_PERIOD | SHORTEST_POSSIBLE\
Interpretation: For any data they do keep, they aim to keep it for the shortest duration feasible. This is a general principle (some things must be kept by law like billing info or backups for a certain time, but they will not exceed those). They likely will define specific periods in practice (which they do in following lines for certain categories). This line is just the guiding theme: only keep data as long as needed.\
Why Useful: Reduces risk of breaches (less data stored, less to steal or leak), and shows respect for user privacy. The AI in designing features should incorporate automatic deletion schedules and ask "Do we really need to store this?" for new data points.\
Extra setting examples: Could set fixed times for everything but they break it down later.

USER_GENERATED_CONTENT_RETENTION_PERIOD | UNTIL_DELETED\
Interpretation: Content that users create (like their <REDACTED_FOR_IP>, answers, files, etc.) will be retained until the user deletes it. So the service won't auto-delete user-generated content on its own (except if user is inactive for a very long time or deletion requested). Basically, as long as the account is active and user hasn't chosen to remove that content, it stays. This is likely because users expect their work to remain available. It's different from activity logs or stale data.\
Why Useful: It clarifies that the product isn't going to purge, say, a <REDACTED_FOR_IP> after X time unless user is gone. Users have control over their content's lifecycle (create, keep as long as they want, or remove when they want). It aligns with being a productivity tool; you don't want to surprise-delete someone's documents. So "until deleted" essentially defers to user action.\
Extra setting examples: They could impose something like auto-delete after 2 years of no edit or something, but they don't, except they do mention account inactivity later.

USER_GENERATED_CONTENT_DELETION_OPTIONS | ARCHIVE; HARD_DELETE\
Interpretation: When a user decides to delete content (like a project), they will offer at least two options: Archive and Hard Delete.

-   Archive: This likely means the content is soft-deleted or moved to an archived state where it's not accessible normally but can be recovered within some timeframe.

-   Hard Delete: Permanent deletion with no retention. Possibly after a confirmation or after a grace period or something, the data is actually erased from system.\
    So users can either just archive (maybe if they want to declutter but keep for records) or fully delete.

Why Useful: Not everyone wants immediate irreversible deletion because they might regret it. Archiving provides a safety net. Yet offering hard delete ensures compliance if someone truly wants data gone. The AI will implement a system where deleting something likely first archives it (or gives a choice UI: "Do you want to archive or permanently delete?"). If archive chosen, data is flagged but kept; if hard delete, it might still archive then auto-purge after grace period or skip archive. Possibly they implement "delete" button does archive by default (like many apps do a soft delete, then you have to go to an archive bin to permanently delete).\
Extra setting examples: They did exactly both, which is nice. Some apps only soft-delete and purge later by policy, but they explicitly allow user to do a direct hard delete if desired (or maybe after archive, with a small waiting period to be safe).

ARCHIVED_CONTENT_RETENTION_PERIOD | 42_DAYS\
Interpretation: Archived content will be retained for 42 days (6 weeks) before being permanently deleted. That implies if user archives something, it stays recoverable for 42 days. After that time, the system will auto-hard-delete it. 42 days is a somewhat specific choice (maybe they wanted 6 weeks instead of 1 month (30) or 2 months (60), splitting the difference or maybe a meaning like "six weeks" just felt right, or they jokingly used 42 because of Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy meaning of 42, but likely just a good timeframe).\
Why Useful: It gives users a window to realize if they need something back (sometimes people realize a few weeks later). 42 days covers a bit more than one month, which is generous. It also ensures the system isn't left holding "archived" stuff indefinitely (which would violate the data minimization pledge). The AI will implement a job (likely daily) that purges any archived items older than 42 days. They should also inform users (maybe at archive time or via an email a few days before final deletion as courtesy perhaps) that their archived item is going to be gone soon, but they didn't explicitly say that email except for inactivity deletion they did mention warnings. Could be nice to do though.\
Extra setting examples: Many services use 30 days for trash retention, they gave a bit more, which is fine.

HARD_DELETE_RETENTION_PERIOD | NONE\
Interpretation: If a user chooses hard delete (immediate deletion), the retention period is none - meaning the data is not retained at all beyond deletion request (aside from maybe backups which are separate, but logically it's gone from live system). "NONE" suggests they won't keep any copy intentionally for any period (some services still keep backups for X days). They likely will try to scrub it even from backups if possible or have a note that backups are pruned regularly, etc. But from user perspective, it's gone.\
Why Useful: It respects the user's desire for complete removal. If a user says hard delete, they want it gone and the system will not hold it. Possibly in privacy policy they'd clarify backup caveat if any, but presumably they'd remove from backups on next cycles since backups retention is separate and limited anyway.\
Extra setting examples: Some might have "we keep hard-deleted data 7 days in case of mistake", but they treat that as archive scenario separate. Hard delete is truly final.

USER_VIEW_OWN_ARCHIVE | TRUE\
Interpretation: Users are allowed to view their archived items (likely through an "Archived items" section or filter). True means the interface will offer a way for users to see what they have archived during that 42-day window.\
Why Useful: So they can confirm something is archived, perhaps restore it if needed. It's akin to a "Trash" folder concept where you can see what's in trash. If they couldn't view archive, they'd have to contact support to retrieve, which is not user-friendly. The AI will ensure there's a UI for archived projects/files. Possibly those items are not in main list but in a separate "Archived <REDACTED_FOR_IP>" list, etc.\
Extra setting examples: Some apps hide archived by default or require support to restore; not here.

USER_RESTORE_OWN_ARCHIVE | TRUE\
Interpretation: Users can restore their archived content themselves without admin intervention. True means if something is archived (within that retention), the user can hit a "Restore" or "Unarchive" button and it becomes active again.\
Why Useful: It empowers users to correct mistakes easily. They don't need to email admin "I accidentally archived X". It's immediate. The AI will implement an unarchive action. This also implies archived content is probably retained with all data intact, just flagged differently, making restoration feasible (not like partially wiped).\
Extra setting examples: If false, they'd have to contact support to restore, which is friction.

PROJECT_PARENTS | USER; ORGANIZATION\
Interpretation: A project (<REDACTED_FOR_IP> project) must belong either to an individual user or to an organization. They allow both contexts. That means they are supporting both personal projects and team projects. Possibly when creating a project, if the user is in an org, they choose to create it under their personal space or under an org space. If under an org, presumably all members can collaborate (depending on roles). This is common, like how GitHub repos can be user or org.\
Why Useful: It gives flexibility: If someone is just using it on their own (not part of an org team), they still can use the app under their user context. For teams, the org context centralizes it. The AI will implement fields in project model like `owner_user` and `owner_org` (one of those set). They have to enforce RLS for both (like RLS might allow either user = current user or org = one of current user's orgs they have access to). It's more complex than just org-only or user-only multi-tenancy, but manageable. It also implies if a user is part of multiple orgs, they might have to pick which org context they are currently working in (like Slack has org switch, etc.), or at least when creating a project choose an org. Possibly default to an org if exists.\
Extra setting examples: They could have forced everything to an org (requiring everyone to create org even for solo use), but they explicitly allow user projects, which lowers barrier for single users.

DELETE_PROJECT_IF_ORPHANED | TRUE\
Interpretation: If a project is left without a parent (orphaned) - e.g., the organization it belonged to was deleted and there's no user owner, or maybe if it belonged to a user who deleted their account and no org, etc. - then the project will itself be deleted. True means they will not keep projects around if they have no valid owner reference.\
Why Useful: It's a data cleanup measure; orphaned data could otherwise linger with no one able to access it, which is unnecessary and a privacy risk. If an org is deleted, all its projects go too (since presumably org deletion is triggered by either all members leaving or admin deciding). If a user is deleted and they had personal projects not part of an org, those become orphaned and thus will be deleted as well (makes sense because if the user left, their personal stuff should go). The AI will ensure appropriate cascading deletion or a process to remove those when the parent is removed.\
Extra setting examples: If false, they'd need to assign orphaned things to someone else or admin, but that could violate privacy (giving someone else's data). So deletion is the correct approach.

USER_INACTIVITY_DELETION_PERIOD | TWO_YEARS_WITH_EMAIL_WARNING\
Interpretation: If a user account has been inactive for two years (24 months) - meaning they haven't logged in or used the service in that time - the account will be deleted, but with an email warning beforehand. That implies they will send one or more emails to the user saying "Your account is about to be deleted due to inactivity, please log in if you want to keep it," probably giving them a window to respond (like maybe 30 days after the email). If no action, then they delete the account and its data.\
Why Useful: This helps minimize data retention by not holding onto accounts indefinitely if they are abandoned. It also frees up resources (like if they had limited user counts, etc.). Two years is a fairly long period, so they ensure that only truly long-gone accounts are removed. The email warning is critical to not surprise someone who might still want their account but just didn't log in (maybe didn't need to for a while). The AI should implement a scheduled job to check last active date and email those beyond 23 months with a notice, then at 24 months do deletion.\
Extra setting examples: Could be shorter or longer; two years is moderate (some do one year, some never auto-delete accounts). They found a middle ground and ensure user is alerted, which is good practice.

ORGANIZATION_INACTIVITY_DELETION_PERIOD | TWO_YEARS_WITH_EMAIL_WARNING\
Interpretation: Similarly, if an entire organization is inactive for two years (likely meaning none of its members have logged in or no activity on any projects), then the organization and presumably all its data will be deleted after warnings. They would email organization owners or all members to warn them prior.\
Why Useful: Orgs might get abandoned if the team stops using it or dissolves. Clearing them eventually helps keep the system clean and free of stale data, and respects privacy (some org data might contain sensitive info, better not keep it if the org is defunct). The warning ensures if the org is still needed, someone can log in to reset the timer. The AI might implement similar to user: track org activity (maybe an org is considered active if any member is active, or if any project updated). They need to define how to measure "org inactivity". Possibly if no member login in 2 years.\
Extra setting examples: They matched it with user period, likely because an org being inactive usually correlates with its members being inactive.

ALLOW_USER_DISABLE_ANALYTICS | TRUE\
Interpretation: Users are given the option to opt out of analytics tracking. True means maybe in settings there's a toggle "Do not track my usage for analytics". If toggled, either the front-end stops sending events to Umami or the backend filters out that user's events. Or they provide a cookie to opt out since Umami can respect that (Umami is privacy friendly and might allow an opt-out parameter).\
Why Useful: Some users (especially maybe NGOs or researchers concerned with privacy) may want to not be tracked. This complies with privacy norms (e.g., GDPR requires allowing opt-out of non-essential tracking). It also shows goodwill beyond law if not strictly required. The AI will implement an opt-out mechanism that when enabled, either disables the analytics script for that user (maybe sets a cookie that Umami knows to skip, or just never calls the tracking events in code). They should also honor do-not-track browser signals possibly.\
Extra setting examples: Some might not offer opt-out if they deem their analytics "essential" or fully anonymized, but giving choice is better.

ENABLE_ACCOUNT_DELETION | TRUE\
Interpretation: They will implement and enable account deletion (which we already saw user may delete account true). This just restates that deletion feature is active. Possibly they mention it to emphasize that maybe it's not only allowed by policy but actually implemented ("enabled"). True means yes, there's a functioning deletion process.\
Why Useful: Ensures that at launch, account deletion is not just theoretical but available. Some services in early days ask you to email support to delete account; here they specifically enable it in-app. It's critical for privacy compliance.\
Extra setting examples: If false, they'd have a contradiction because user may delete was true; so likely this flag is to actually toggle the feature in UI depending on readiness, but they have it on.

MAINTAIN_DELETED_ACCOUNT_RECORDS | FALSE\
Interpretation: They will not maintain any records of accounts after they are deleted. That means they won't keep a stub like "User X (deleted)" in the database. They likely fully remove the user row and all related personal data. They won't, for instance, keep an entry to block reuse of the same email (some systems keep a "tombstone" record to prevent re-signup with same email, but that contradicts not maintaining records; they'd allow re-signup which is fine). They might not even keep the user's ID in logs (or they might anonymize logs).\
Why Useful: Truly honoring deletion means no lingering personal data. It's stricter than some companies do (some keep minimal info for audit or to prevent fraud; they explicitly choose not to). It shows strong privacy stance but has trade-off: someone could sign up again with the same email and they wouldn't necessarily know it's the same person as before (which might be fine, or could allow some exploitation like repeated free trial abuse, but they didn't mention such counter measure, maybe they accept that risk or will address differently).\
Extra setting examples: If they had legal requirement to keep something (like invoices), they'd keep those separate from user personal profile. But "maintain records: false" means wipe nearly all.

ACCOUNT_DELETION_GRACE_PERIOD | 7_DAYS_THEN_HARD_DELETE\
Interpretation: After a user requests account deletion, there will be a 7-day grace period before the account is permanently deleted. After 7 days, a hard delete occurs. This implies they implement a pending deletion state: user initiates deletion, account maybe gets deactivated and marked for deletion on X date. They might allow user to cancel deletion in that window (like log back in to abort deletion). If no action, at 7 days the deletion job runs to remove it all.\
Why Useful: It serves as a safety net for users who might change their mind or who triggered deletion accidentally or in distress and then reconsider. Also if a malicious person got into account and tried to delete it, the real owner has time (assuming they see email or try to log in) to recover. It's standard (e.g., Facebook does 30 days, many do 14 days). They chose 7 days, which is relatively short but sufficient in many cases. Possibly because they want to minimize retention of data user wanted gone.\
Extra setting examples: Could be longer, but shorter is more privacy-forward. The AI must ensure to send an email when deletion is requested (so user knows and can intervene in that week). At day 7, everything goes (including any content, presumably aside from what legally must remain, if any).

All these privacy measures ensure users can trust the service with their data and that it complies with regulations and good practices.

Next, [COMMIT] guidelines ensure repository hygiene:

[COMMIT] -- Version Control Commit Standards
-------------------------------------------

*This section defines rules for commit messages and repository content.*

REQUIRE_COMMIT_MESSAGES | TRUE\
Interpretation: Commits must have a message (not an empty or default message). Likely enforced via commit hooks or just by convention. True means they should always provide a descriptive commit message for each commit. No committing without a message.\
Why Useful: It maintains a clear history. Possibly part of CI (like if commit message missing, maybe the commit hook rejects it). The AI when auto-committing code (if it does automated commits) should always add a message.\
Extra setting examples: Could be obvious but some inexperienced devs commit with no message or trivial ones; they want to avoid that.

COMMIT_MESSAGE_STYLE | CONVENTIONAL_COMMITS; CHANGELOG\
Interpretation: They expect commit messages to follow Conventional Commits style (e.g., prefix like "feat:", "fix:", "chore:", etc.), and be suitable for generating a changelog. Conventional Commits is a standardized format that includes a type, scope, and description, which can be parsed to automatically produce release notes. This suggests commit messages like "feat(ui): add collaboration invite key feature" or "fix(auth): resolve OAuth linking bug".\
Why Useful: It ensures commit log is structured, which aids in auto-generating a changelog (the second keyword indicates they intend to produce CHANGELOG from commits). It also encourages thoughtful messages that categorize changes (features, fixes, breaking changes, etc.). The AI if writing commits should use this format properly.\
Extra setting examples: They explicitly mention conventional_commits and changelog, which is common in projects that use semantic versioning. Another style could be something like just freeform but they prefer this formal approach.

EXCLUDE_FROM_PUSH | CACHES; LOGS; TEMP_FILES; BUILD_ARTIFACTS; ENV_FILES; SECRET_FILES; DOCS/*; IDE_SETTINGS_FILES; OS_FILES; COPILOT_INSTRUCTIONS_FILE\
Interpretation: This is a list of patterns or file types that should not be committed/pushed to the repository. It likely forms part of .gitignore.\
They include:

-   Caches: (like .cache directories, or pip cache, node_modules maybe considered caches or separate build artifact)

-   Logs: any log files generated should be ignored (like *.log)

-   Temp_files: e.g., *~ files, .tmp, etc.

-   Build_artifacts: like compiled output (dist/, build/, possibly static bundles, etc. - those should not be in VCS if they can be built)

-   Env_files: like .env containing secrets or config, definitely not to commit.

-   Secret_files: any other file containing secrets or keys (maybe config files with secrets or keystore)

-   Docs/*: interestingly they say docs/* to exclude - perhaps they mean not to push built docs or maybe not to push some subfolder of docs if they generate something? But they earlier have docs in code as markdown that should be committed. It's possible they mean if docs site generates HTML or something, don't commit those. Or maybe "DOCS/*" refers to something else (maybe they consider lengthy documentation or outputs should not go to main branch? It's a bit odd since they did include docs in repo by listing them). Could be a miscommunication; maybe they mean exclude docs generated from code (like Sphinx html).

-   IDE_settings_files: like .vscode/, .idea/, etc.

-   OS_files: like .DS_Store (macOS), Thumbs.db, etc.

-   Copilot_instructions_file: explicitly, do not push the file that contains these instructions (since probably it's in the repo only locally for the AI to read, but not meant for commit). It's considered sensitive internal config not to share.

Why Useful: Keeps the repository clean of files that don't belong or pose security risks (env/secrets). It also helps avoid accidentally leaking credentials. The AI, if controlling commits, should ensure these patterns in .gitignore. Particularly copilot-instructions should not leak, which might have internal strategies or just clutter.\
Extra setting examples: It's basically a thorough .gitignore. Possibly they might add the node_modules which I'm not sure if implicitly covered by "build artifacts" (though node_modules is more dependency than build artifact; typically you do ignore it). Maybe caches covers node_modules? Usually you'd list node_modules explicitly, so maybe an oversight. But since they mention build artifacts probably they consider node_modules not to commit either. The AI should confirm the .gitignore covers all these.

Finally, [BUILD] and [BUILD_CONFIG] and [ACTION] etc., which are more technical for deployment and how the agent should operate.

Let's parse [BUILD]:

[BUILD] -- Deployment and Build Configuration
--------------------------------------------

*This section describes how the application is packaged, served, and deployed.*

DEPLOYMENT_TYPE | SPA_WITH_BUNDLED_LANDING\
Interpretation: They will deploy as a Single Page Application for the app itself, with a bundled landing page. That likely means the marketing landing page (the homepage explaining the product, maybe docs, etc.) is part of the same front-end build or served by the same server (perhaps as static content) rather than a separate site. "Bundled landing" suggests that the landing page (which could be just index route of the React app or separate static HTML) is included in the deployable. Possibly they might have a static landing page built with the same build tools or just an HTML served by the proxy that then hands off to the app for the web app routes. But likely the whole site is an SPA including public homepage.\
Why Useful: Simplicity in deployment (one artifact handles both marketing site and app). They won't maintain two separate codebases for site and app. This might mean the React app has routes for "Home", "Features" (public pages) as well as protected app pages, or they pre-build a static landing and serve it. The AI will ensure that either approach is considered in routing (like maybe if user not logged in and goes to root, show landing content, if logged in go to dashboard - or separate domain for app vs landing but they said bundled so probably same). It affects how the front-end is structured.\
Extra setting examples: Could have had a static generated marketing site with SSR and the app separate, but they combined.

DEPLOYMENT | COOLIFY\
Interpretation: They plan to use Coolify for deployment. Coolify is an open-source self-hosted PaaS (Platform as a Service) that can deploy apps via Docker, handle CI/CD, etc. It's like a Heroku alternative that you run yourself. This means the project will be set up to deploy to a server running Coolify.\
Why Useful: They likely have a VPS with Coolify to manage the containers for this app. The AI might not need to deeply integrate with Coolify besides providing Dockerfile or config that Coolify expects. It's a hint that the deliverables will be containerized and integrated into a Coolify pipeline (which often just monitors a repo and deploys on push).\
Extra setting examples: Could have been Docker Compose manual, or Kubernetes, but they chose Coolify which automates a lot.

DEPLOY_VIA | GIT_PUSH\
Interpretation: Deployments are triggered by pushing to the Git repository (likely to a specific branch like main or a release branch). This suggests a CI/CD pipeline is set such that on push, the building and deploying happens (maybe via GitHub Actions and Coolify or via Coolify's built-in Git webhooks).\
Why Useful: It's the common approach for continuous deployment. The AI should ensure that main branch stays deployable and tests pass before pushing (they do gating in CD config below). It also means no manual FTP or so, it's integrated.\
Extra setting examples: Could have been manual triggers or scheduled, but push is typical.

WEBSERVER | VITE\
Interpretation: This is a bit unusual because Vite is mainly a dev server and build tool. Perhaps they mean the front-end is served by Vite's preview or dev server in development, but for production, typically you'd serve static files (unless using SSR or something). Or maybe they plan to run a Node server using Vite's preview (which can serve a build). Alternatively, maybe they use Vite SSR to serve content. But likely they mean they're using Vite's dev server for development and for preview in staging, but in production, static files will be served by a web server (could be Traefik or something static-serving). It's listed under build though, so possibly they treat Vite as the "webserver" in dev environment section.\
Why Useful: If they indeed use Vite preview for some reason in production, it would serve the built assets and maybe handle proxies to API (if not using a separate static file server). However, usually you wouldn't do that in production (you could just have Traefik serve static or use a CDN). This is a bit confusing in context. But I'll interpret it as either: they intend to use Vite's preview (which is essentially an Express static server) in container to serve the app's UI files, or it's just referencing that Vite is the main tool handling web content.\
Extra setting examples: They might have used Nginx to serve static front-end if not using Vite preview. If Coolify deploys a static site, it might spin up an Nginx automatically. I suspect they won't run Vite dev in production, probably an oversight or a shorthand for "Vite dev server in dev mode, static in prod". We'll keep an eye.

REVERSE_PROXY | TRAEFIK\
Interpretation: They will use Traefik as the reverse proxy for the app. Traefik will handle incoming requests, routing them to appropriate containers (maybe one for backend, one for frontend static, etc.), and handle TLS, etc. They already indicated reverse proxy enabled. Traefik is often used in container environments like Coolify because it dynamically configures routes using container labels.\
Why Useful: Traefik is modern, works great with Docker (Coolify likely uses it by default). The AI should ensure to include proper Traefik labels in the Docker compose or config to route `<REDACTED_FOR_IP>.io` to the correct service and set up things like HSTS, etc., according to earlier rules. It might also handle ACME (Let's Encrypt) for certificates.\
Extra setting examples: Nginx is alternative but they prefer Traefik's automation.

BUILD_TOOL | VITE\
Interpretation: They use Vite as the build tool for the front-end (to bundle and optimize the React app). Already indicated in the stack where they said React & Tailwind (likely integrated via Vite). So nothing new here except confirming it's for building (which will produce static assets).\
Why Useful: Vite is known for fast dev and good production build using Rollup under the hood. The AI should ensure to have a production build command via Vite.\
Extra setting examples: It's the obvious one since they chose Vite/React.

BUILD_PACK | COOLIFY_READY_DOCKERFILE\
Interpretation: They will provide a Dockerfile that is ready for Coolify's build process. Possibly meaning the repository will contain a Dockerfile configured in a way that Coolify expects (maybe multi-stage to produce an image with both front-end and back-end or separate? Possibly one image with backend and one with static for front-end). Or could be a slight misnomer, but likely they intend to use Dockerfile method in Coolify (Coolify can either use Heroku buildpacks, or just build using a Dockerfile if present). "Coolify Ready" suggests they have to tailor it so that environment variables and healthchecks align with what Coolify expects.\
Why Useful: Ensures smooth deployment on Coolify with minimal manual config. The AI will craft a Dockerfile (or multiple if needed) accordingly. Possibly a multi-stage Dockerfile: one stage builds front-end with Vite, the other stage is base for Django, then copy assets and run server, etc. So one container runs Django + serves static or runs backend, and maybe static served by whitenoise or so. Or they might deploy front and back as separate services, but then need two Dockerfiles or a docker-compose. However, since they said deployment type SPA with bundled landing, they might serve static with Django or a simple server, meaning one container approach.\
Extra setting examples: If not using Dockerfile, they could use buildpack or just source build on target, but they want explicit Dockerfile.

HOSTING | CLOUD_VPS\
Interpretation: They host on a Cloud Virtual Private Server. That implies they're not using something like AWS App Runner or Heroku, but rather a VPS (like DigitalOcean droplet, AWS EC2, etc.) where they run Coolify and everything. It's basically self-hosted environment.\
Why Useful: It's cost-effective and gives control. The AI should keep in mind that things like file storage S3 might be external or local (if they run MinIO on VPS or connect to DigitalOcean Spaces, etc.). Also might have to ensure to not assume cloud managed services beyond what specified.\
Extra setting examples: Could be on-prem or serverless, but they went with a stable known approach.

EXPOSE_PORTS | FALSE\
Interpretation: They do not intend to expose container ports directly to the internet. Likely everything goes through Traefik which handles mapping domain to containers. `FALSE` means in Docker context, the containers won't have host ports open (just internal). Traefik will route via internal Docker network. This is more secure.\
Why Useful: It prevents someone bypassing Traefik's configured routes/policies by hitting an IP:port directly. Also means one can't accidentally have two things trying to use same host port. The AI should ensure Docker compose doesn't have `ports:` mapping (Traefik uses labels instead to route).\
Extra setting examples: If true, they'd open say backend on 8000, which is not needed with Traefik.

HEALTH_CHECKS | TRUE\
Interpretation: They will have health check endpoints and monitoring to ensure containers are running properly. True means presumably each service (like backend) should have a health check URL (maybe `/health` returning 200) that Coolify/Traefik can ping, and the deployment pipeline will verify health after deploy. They might also have container healthcheck in Dockerfile.\
Why Useful: Automatic detection of failing containers and ability to rollback if new deploy is not healthy. It aligns with "require health check 200" in build config later. The AI will implement a simple endpoint in Django (maybe via a library or just a view that checks DB connection etc.) and possibly add `HEALTHCHECK` in Dockerfile.\
Extra setting examples: Some skip it and just rely on container up, but they explicitly want it.

Now [BUILD_CONFIG] with CI/CD specifics:

[BUILD_CONFIG] -- Continuous Integration/Deployment and Build Settings
---------------------------------------------------------------------

*This section outlines specific CI/CD pipeline requirements and build strategies.*

KEEP_USER_INSTALL_CHECKLIST_UP_TO_DATE | CRITICAL\
Interpretation: It's marked as critical priority to keep the install guide (User Checklist) updated. That means any change that affects how to set up or run the project must be reflected in the install_guide.md immediately. They consider this extremely important (maybe because they had pain with outdated docs in the past). Possibly might fail CI if docs not updated? Not sure if they enforce automatically, but maybe part of code review.\
Why Useful: So new developers or deployers can always rely on the documentation to work. It's critical because if it falls behind, someone could be blocked. The AI, when making changes (like adding a new dependency that needs an OS package or env var), should update the checklist doc as part of after_action_alignment.\
Extra setting examples: They set CRITICAL to emphasize priority; they might even check diffs to see if relevant changes touched the docs or not.

CI_TOOL | GITHUB_ACTIONS\
Interpretation: They use GitHub Actions for Continuous Integration (and possibly partially for deployment). GitHub Actions will run tests, linters, etc. It's integrated with the GitHub repo.\
Why Useful: Good choice as code is likely on GitHub and Actions is convenient. The AI might provide config files (.github/workflows) to run actions for things like lint/test, etc. They already specify what runs in CI. Also possibly to build Docker images if needed (though Coolify might handle build itself on push). But they did list CI runs which implies actions do those.\
Extra setting examples: Could have used GitLab CI, Jenkins, etc., but GH Actions is easier to set up in a new project.

CI_RUNS | LINT; TESTS; SECURITY_AUDIT\
Interpretation: The CI pipeline will run the linter (Ruff, ESLint), run tests (back-end tests and front-end tests presumably), and run the security audit (Snyk). These are done likely on each push or PR.\
Why Useful: Automated assurance of code quality and security before merge. They separated them from CD (where build and deploy also happen). Possibly CI runs on every push, CD only on main branch or when triggered. The AI will set up GH Actions jobs for these steps, and ensure they all must pass.\
Extra setting examples: They indeed included all major checks except building the image, which is reserved for CD.

CD_RUNS | LINT; TESTS; SECURITY_AUDIT; BUILD; DEPLOY\
Interpretation: The Continuous Deployment pipeline (when triggered for deploy) will also run Lint, Tests, Security audit (maybe again or ensure latest code still passes them), then if all good, perform the Build (build container or artifacts) and then Deploy (to the server). This presumably only runs for production deployment, possibly triggered manually or on push to main depending on config.\
Why Useful: It acts as a gate: if any quality check fails, it won't deploy broken or insecure code. Even though CI runs those earlier, they double-check in CD just in case something changed or the branch had new commits since last CI. It's belt and suspenders to avoid deploying something failing.\
Extra setting examples: They might skip repeating tests in CD if they're confident in CI, but here they ensure everything is passed again or at least gating. Possibly they mean the same tasks run but logically, they won't deploy if CI already said fail. GH Actions might allow requiring passing status. But writing them explicitly in CD ensures if someone manually triggers a deploy outside main, it still checks.

CD_REQUIRE_PASSING_CI | TRUE\
Interpretation: The deployment pipeline will only proceed if CI was passing. True means if tests/lint aren't green on the commit, it should not deploy. This is probably enforced by config or by status checks. It's redundant with above but emphasizes that CD depends on CI success.\
Why Useful: Prevents deploying unverified code. It's likely that the main branch is protected to require CI to pass, but also this setting ensures an extra check. The AI might ensure the CD job checks that prior jobs (lint/test) succeeded.\
Extra setting examples: Could allow override but they say require true.

OVERRIDE_SNYK_FALSE_POSITIVES | TRUE\
Interpretation: They will override known false positives in Snyk (as mentioned in security), meaning CI/CD should not fail on those once flagged and marked. True means implement ignoring them so they don't block pipeline. Probably in Snyk config or in CI steps they might use `snyk test --ignore-policy` or ensure they maintain an ignore list.\
Why Useful: It ensures that if Snyk erroneously flags something and they've decided it's safe, they won't let that keep breaking builds. They already plan to do that.\
Extra setting examples: Already discussed above basically.

CD_DEPLOY_ON | MANUAL_APPROVAL\
Interpretation: Deployment to production requires a manual approval step. That likely means even after CI passes, someone (like an admin or DevOps engineer) has to click "approve" or "deploy" for it to actually push to production. Possibly done via GitHub Actions environment protection rules or in Coolify's UI (maybe they have a hold on deploy until manual confirm).\
Why Useful: It adds a final human check to ensure nothing crazy is going out (especially since this is pre-release stage product, they might not want continuous automatic deploy yet, or want to group releases). It also could allow review of changes or scheduling deploy at low-traffic time. The AI can configure GH Actions with an environment that requires approval.\
Extra setting examples: Some teams auto deploy every commit to main (could have been 'auto'), but manual is safer in early stage.

BUILD_TARGET | DOCKER_CONTAINER\
Interpretation: The target format for builds is a Docker container. So they containerize the app (makes sense since using Coolify). They are not building, say, a VM image or just code tarball. This confirms they'll produce an image. Possibly a multi-container (backend and front separate) but maybe one container as we discussed.\
Why Useful: It's needed for Coolify and easy to run anywhere. The AI will ensure Dockerfile and GH Actions to build/publish it if needed.\
Extra setting examples: If building a static site, target could be static files, but since there's backend, container covers it.

REQUIRE_HEALTH_CHECKS_200 | TRUE\
Interpretation: After deployment, require that health check endpoints return HTTP 200 OK (healthy) in order to consider the deployment successful. True means likely the CD pipeline or Coolify will check /health or similar. If it doesn't return 200, it will trigger a rollback or mark failure.\
Why Useful: Catches any runtime issues quickly (like maybe the server failed to start properly, etc.). The AI will ensure the health endpoint is robust and returns 200 only if fully functional (maybe it checks DB connectivity too).\
Extra setting examples: If false, they'd deploy and maybe only monitor externally. They want automated verification.

ROLLBACK_ON_FAILURE | TRUE\
Interpretation: If a deployment fails (health check fails, tests fail at last minute, etc.), automatically rollback to the previous stable version. True means they will not leave a broken version running. This suggests using a method to quickly revert (maybe Coolify has versioning or they spin up new container and only switch traffic if healthy, which is common in blue-green or similar).\
Why Useful: Minimizes downtime or bad experience because if new version doesn't start or is unhealthy, the system continues on old version seamlessly. The AI might not implement rollback logic itself (the platform might do it), but possibly in GitHub Actions they'd re-deploy the last known good image. Or if using container orchestration, they might not take down old until new is up.\
Extra setting examples: They clearly prioritize reliability here.

Finally, [ACTION], [BEFORE_ACTION_CHECKS], [PLANNING], [RUNTIME], [VALIDATION], [ALIGNMENT], [CLEANUP], [AUDIT], [REFACTOR], [DOCUMENT] specify the agent's operational guidelines. These are likely meant for the AI itself on how to conduct tasks when user issues commands /agent, /audit, etc. It's akin to how the AI should proceed with tasks. It's very meta: basically telling how ChatGPT (as coding assistant) should behave in phases.

We should interpret them likely as how the agent should plan and implement code changes. However, since the question is we (the AI) summarizing the instructions, we should interpret them as instructions to "the AI agent" on how to perform changes.

We actually already integrated a lot of those in analysis above, but let's systematically do it:

[ACTION] -- Bound Command and Sequence for Code Changes
-------------------------------------------------------

*This section defines how the AI's "action mode" is triggered and outlines the ordered phases it must follow to perform code changes.*

**BOUND-COMMAND** | ACTION_COMMAND (`/agent`)\\
**Interpretation:** This ties the general "action" workflow to a specific user command. In practice, whenever a user message begins with the `/agent` prefix, the AI knows it should enter its coding/execution mode, using the rules defined in this [ACTION] section. The rest of the user's input after `/agent` will be parsed as tasks or goals for the AI to implement in the codebase. Essentially, `/agent` is the trigger that switches the AI from a normal chat assistant into a **software engineer mode**that plans and writes code.\
**Why Useful:** Having a dedicated command for initiating code actions prevents confusion and accidental code changes. The user must explicitly invoke `/agent` to start the development workflow, which acts as a safety mechanism -- a casual question or greeting won't inadvertently make the AI start altering code. It also makes conversation logs clearer: one can easily see where a formal coding session starts. This structured approach ensures that the AI only performs potentially high-impact operations when the user truly intends it.\
**Extra setting examples:** In another system, this command could have been named differently (for example, `ACTION_COMMAND | /execute` or `/devmode`). The key point is using an unambiguous trigger. Some setups might even allow a one-character command like `!` to toggle action mode, but a full word (like `/agent`) is more explicit. If commands weren't required at all, the AI would have to infer user intent from context -- a far less reliable and riskier method than having a clear prefix.

**ACTION_RUNTIME_ORDER** | BEFORE_ACTION_CHECKS; BEFORE_ACTION_PLANNING; ACTION_RUNTIME; AFTER_ACTION_VALIDATION; AFTER_ACTION_ALIGNMENT; AFTER_ACTION_CLEANUP\\
**Interpretation:** This defines the *exact sequence of phases* the AI will execute whenever an `/agent` action is triggered. In order, the AI must first perform **"Before Action Checks"** (preliminary safety and feasibility checks), then **"Before Action Planning"** (organize tasks and get approval), then the actual **"Action Runtime"** (performing the code changes), followed by **"After Action Validation"** (testing and quality checks), then **"After Action Alignment"** (updating documentation and ancillary materials), and finally **"After Action Cleanup"** (cleaning up any temporary or sensitive data). By listing these steps, the config ensures the AI's workflow is systematic and covers everything from start to finish.\
**Why Useful:** A well-defined sequence guarantees that the AI doesn't skip critical steps. It enforces a kind of **mini project lifecycle** on every code change: check preconditions, plan carefully, execute, then verify and tidy up. This leads to higher quality outcomes. For example, with this order the AI will *always* run tests and security audits after coding, and *always*update docs and clean up, rather than forgetting those in a rush. It makes the AI's operations more predictable and thorough, reducing the chance of errors or oversights.\
**Extra setting examples:** If one wanted a different process, they could alter this order or remove phases. For instance, a simpler system might omit the Alignment or Cleanup phases, or merge some steps together. In this configuration, however, every phase from planning to cleanup is explicitly included. This comprehensive approach is a bit slower but maximizes reliability. Another project might sequence things differently (e.g., do documentation updates in the runtime phase), but separating them as done here helps clarity and ensures each step is addressed in turn.

[BEFORE_ACTION_CHECKS] -- Preliminary Checks Before Execution
-------------------------------------------------------------

*This section enumerates conditions the AI must evaluate **before** writing any code, and the prescribed response for each scenario. These checks act as safeguards and decision points to handle special situations or potential problems upfront.*

**IF_BETTER_SOLUTION** | PROPOSE_ALTERNATIVE\\
**Interpretation:** If the AI realizes that the user's requested approach or solution is not optimal and there's a clearly better solution available, it should pause and **propose an alternative** solution to the user instead of blindly proceeding. In other words, the AI won't just implement a subpar design; it will suggest a superior approach for user consideration.\
**Why Useful:** This encourages the AI to actively apply its expertise and not follow instructions off a cliff. For example, if the user asks for a complex workaround but the AI knows a simpler, more elegant method exists, it will present that alternative. This leads to better outcomes and educates the user on best approaches. It ensures the project benefits from the AI's full knowledge rather than strictly adhering to potentially flawed instructions.\
**Extra setting examples:** If this were set differently (or not present), the AI might implement whatever it's told, even if it's not ideal. In some scenarios, one might prefer the AI to always ask the user no matter what (making *any* alternative a question) or always just implement the better way by default. Here, **PROPOSE_ALTERNATIVE** strikes a balance: it doesn't change course without permission, but it does raise the idea to the user, which is usually the best practice in collaborative environments.

**IF_NOT_BEST_PRACTICES** | PROPOSE_ALTERNATIVE\\
**Interpretation:** If the user's request or the solution they want goes against established **best practices** (for coding style, architecture, security, etc.), the AI should suggest a different approach that **follows best practices**, rather than immediately doing something that's known to be poor form. This is similar in spirit to the above rule but focused specifically on best-practice violations.\
**Why Useful:** It acts as a quality filter. For instance, if a user asks to hard-code a password in source code (which is a bad practice), the AI would suggest a safer alternative (like using environment variables or a config file) instead of just doing it. This ensures that the codebase remains clean, secure, and maintainable by default. It also educates the user by highlighting when their desired solution might cause issues down the line.\
**Extra setting examples:** In another configuration, the AI could be made stricter or looser. A stricter variant might refuse outright to do non-best-practice implementations unless overridden. A looser variant might just comply without comment. Here, proposing an alternative strikes a middle ground, maintaining quality while still involving the user in the decision if they insist on the original approach.

**USER_MAY_OVERRIDE_BEST_PRACTICES** | TRUE\\
**Interpretation:** This flag means that **if** the AI has suggested an alternative for best-practice reasons (as per the rule above) but the user insists on proceeding with their original request, the AI will comply. In essence, the user has the final say and can override the AI's best-practices advice.\
**Why Useful:** It preserves user autonomy. There might be legitimate reasons to break best practices occasionally (due to time constraints, legacy integration requirements, etc.). By setting this to true, the system acknowledges that while the AI should recommend better solutions, the user can explicitly direct the AI to do it their way regardless. This prevents deadlocks where the AI might otherwise refuse to proceed.\
**Extra setting examples:** If this were **FALSE**, the AI would refuse to violate best practices even if the user asked -- effectively the AI's "professional judgment" would trump the user's request. That could be safer for code quality but frustrating in scenarios where exceptions are needed. By allowing override, they strike a balance: the AI advocates for good practice but doesn't become obstinate if the user understands the risks and still wants to go ahead.

**IF_LEGACY_CODE** | PROPOSE_REFACTOR_AWAIT_APPROVAL\\
**Interpretation:** If the AI is about to work on or around **legacy code** (old, crusty code that likely needs improvement), it should suggest a **refactor** of that code and pause for user approval before doing so. Legacy code might refer to outdated modules, old patterns, or code that doesn't meet current standards. The AI won't immediately refactor without asking, but it will signal that "this code is old and could be improved" and offer to clean it up as part of the task.\
**Why Useful:** It proactively addresses technical debt. Instead of piling new code on a shaky foundation, the AI flags the opportunity to modernize that foundation first. For example, if adding a feature touches a module written years ago in a deprecated style, the AI can propose updating that module (improving maintainability and compatibility) before adding new stuff. This leads to a healthier codebase long-term.\
**Extra setting examples:** One could imagine treating legacy code differently depending on context. Sometimes teams opt to "leave legacy code as is" to avoid risk; in that case, this might be set to simply proceed without refactoring. Here, however, they choose to refactor when possible (with approval), indicating a priority on code quality even if it means extra work.

**IF_DEPRECATED_CODE** | PROPOSE_REFACTOR_AWAIT_APPROVAL\\
**Interpretation:** If the AI encounters **deprecated code** -- meaning functions, libraries, or patterns that have been officially superseded and shouldn't be used anymore -- it should propose refactoring that code out or upgrading it to the supported alternative, awaiting user approval. Essentially, the AI says "we're using something deprecated here; I can update it if you allow me."\
**Why Useful:** Deprecated code can pose future compatibility and security issues. By flagging and offering to replace it, the AI helps keep the project up-to-date. For example, if it finds the code uses an old library version that's no longer maintained, it might propose switching to the newer version or different library. Handling this during an action prevents accumulating outdated code that might break with future updates.\
**Extra setting examples:** If this were not included, the AI might leave deprecated calls in place, which could be fine short-term but problematic long-term. They've chosen to be proactive. Some configs might distinguish levels of deprecation (e.g., critical deprecation vs. mild warnings) but here any deprecated element triggers a refactor suggestion.

**IF_OBSOLETE_CODE** | PROPOSE_REFACTOR_AWAIT_APPROVAL\\
**Interpretation:** If the AI detects **obsolete code**, meaning code that is effectively outdated or no longer relevant (for instance, an old feature's remnants or support for a scenario that's no longer needed), it should propose removing or refactoring that code, with user approval. Obsolete code might not be officially "deprecated" by an external source, but by the project's context it's not useful anymore.\
**Why Useful:** This keeps the codebase lean. Obsolete code can confuse developers or cause bugs if mistakenly invoked. By cleaning it up when noticed, the AI helps prevent "dead code" from hanging around. For example, if there's a function never used or a config for a feature that was removed, the AI would offer to prune it. Regularly trimming such code makes maintenance easier and reduces attack surface (unused code can still harbor vulnerabilities).\
**Extra setting examples:** Not all projects remove obsolete code promptly -- some keep it around just in case. But this configuration favors active cleanup. Another approach could be to mark it but not remove it (comment it out or put behind a flag), but here they lean toward outright refactoring it away once approved.

**IF_REDUNDANT_CODE** | PROPOSE_REFACTOR_AWAIT_APPROVAL\\
**Interpretation:** If the AI finds **redundant code** -- meaning duplicate code or functionality that overlaps with something else -- it will propose refactoring to eliminate the redundancy (for example, merging duplicate functions or removing one of them), pending user approval.\
**Why Useful:** Redundant code violates the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle, making the codebase larger and harder to maintain. By catching redundancy before adding more, the AI keeps things streamlined. For instance, if the user asks to implement a function and the AI notices a similar function already exists, it might propose using or modifying the existing one rather than writing a new duplicate. This leads to simpler, cleaner code.\
**Extra setting examples:** An alternative might be to ignore redundancy unless explicitly asked (some might not want the AI to refactor beyond the scope of the user's request). But here the AI is encouraged to point it out and offer a fix. This suggests the maintainers want continuous improvement even beyond the exact task at hand.

**IF_CONFLICTS** | PROPOSE_REFACTOR_AWAIT_APPROVAL\\
**Interpretation:** If the tasks at hand or the code changes are going to introduce **conflicts** -- for example, a merge conflict with another branch or a logical conflict with existing functionality -- the AI should propose a refactoring or reorganization to resolve those conflicts (again, only proceeding with approval). Essentially, rather than plowing ahead and leaving a conflict, the AI pauses and offers a plan to reconcile the differences cleanly.\
**Why Useful:** It addresses problems that would otherwise surface later (like when merging code or when two features collide in functionality). By handling conflicts proactively, they avoid broken builds or contradictory features. For instance, if two parts of the system have overlapping responsibilities that conflict, the AI might suggest refactoring them into one unified approach. This keeps the project coherent and saves time that would be spent fixing conflicts after they cause failures.\
**Extra setting examples:** In some setups, conflict resolution might be left entirely to human developers or post-merge tools. Here, they empower the AI to help with it. It implies a high level of trust in the AI to identify and suggest fixes for architectural or merge conflicts. If this were false or not present, the AI might just warn about conflicts and stop, leaving it to the user to handle.

**IF_PURPOSE_VIOLATION** | ASK_USER\\
**Interpretation:** If fulfilling the user's request would **violate the intended purpose** or goals of the product (for example, implementing a feature that goes against the product's mission or misuses the system), the AI should pause and directly **ask the user** how to proceed. It essentially flags, "This doesn't align with why we're building this product. Are you sure you want to do this?"\
**Why Useful:** It keeps the project on track with its vision. Sometimes users (or even team members) might propose ideas out of scope or contrary to the project's objectives; this check gives a moment to reconsider. For example, if the project is meant to be a simple nonprofit tool, and a user asks to add a complex ad-tracking system (which might violate the product's privacy focus or simplicity goal), the AI would alert them. This ensures that strategic decisions get human confirmation.\
**Extra setting examples:** If this were not included, the AI might implement anything asked, even if it dilutes or harms the product ethos. Conversely, one could have the AI outright refuse purpose-violating requests without asking (for a stricter safeguard), but asking is more flexible, allowing human override if the context has changed or if it was a conscious choice to deviate.

**IF_UNSURE** | ASK_USER\\
**Interpretation:** If the AI is **unsure** about what to do -- for instance, the user's instructions are ambiguous or the AI lacks confidence in how to proceed -- it should stop and ask the user for clarification or guidance.\
**Why Useful:** This prevents the AI from guessing and possibly doing something wrong. By seeking clarification, it ensures the user's intent is correctly understood. For example, if the user says "Improve the login system" and it's not clear whether they mean security, UI, or performance improvement, the AI would ask for specifics rather than picking one at random. This leads to more accurate and satisfactory outcomes.\
**Extra setting examples:** If not handled, an unsure AI might either do nothing (silently fail) or make an assumption (which could be incorrect). By explicitly asking the user, the process remains transparent. Some systems might allow the AI to make an educated guess if low risk, but this config leans toward always clarifying when in doubt.

**IF_CONFLICT** | ASK_USER\\
**Interpretation:** If a **conflict** arises that doesn't fall under the earlier "IF_CONFLICTS" rule -- likely meaning any conflict in requirements or understanding (for example, contradictory user instructions or goals) -- the AI should consult the user. It essentially says, "There's a conflict here (in what you asked or between new and existing requirements); how would you like to resolve it?"\
**Why Useful:** It ensures nothing moves forward under conflicting assumptions. For instance, if one part of the user's request says "make the app single-user" and another part says "support multiple organizations," the AI would flag this conflict. By asking, the user can clarify which direction to take. This saves time and prevents the AI from implementing something the user didn't intend.\
**Extra setting examples:** This is a general safety net. Many projects rely on human project managers to catch such conflicts, but here the AI is actively checking. If this were not included, the AI might pick one side of a conflict arbitrarily or merge them in a way that doesn't satisfy the user. Prompting the user is the safest approach to keep everyone aligned.

**IF_MISSING_INFO** | ASK_USER\\
**Interpretation:** If some **information is missing** from the user's request or the task (like the user didn't specify a crucial detail: e.g., which file to modify, what threshold to use, etc.), the AI should ask the user for that information.\
**Why Useful:** It avoids making assumptions and ensures the AI has all necessary details to do the job correctly. For example, "Add an API endpoint" -- if the user doesn't say what data it should serve or what it should be called, the AI shouldn't just guess those things. By asking, the AI gets the missing parameters or context, resulting in a correct implementation.\
**Extra setting examples:** In some scenarios, the AI might attempt to infer missing info from context or defaults (especially if user is not available to ask), but that can lead to errors. Here the preference is clearly to involve the user whenever something important is undefined.

**IF_SECURITY_RISK** | ABORT_AND_ALERT_USER\\
**Interpretation:** If the AI determines that proceeding with the request would introduce a **security risk** or vulnerability, it must immediately **abort the action and alert the user** about the issue. This is a hard stop scenario. For instance, if a user's request is to implement something known to be insecure (like using an outdated encryption algorithm or disabling validation on inputs), the AI will refuse to do it and explain the security concern.\
**Why Useful:** Security is non-negotiable here. This rule ensures the AI will not knowingly compromise the application's safety. By aborting, it prevents dangerous code from ever being written. Alerting the user educates them on why the action was halted. For example, if asked to store passwords in plain text, the AI would stop and say why that's a bad idea. This policy keeps the product safe and also trains the user in secure practices.\
**Extra setting examples:** One might wonder if the AI could *ask* the user in such cases ("Are you sure? This is risky."), but this config says to abort outright -- indicating zero tolerance for known security issues. It's a strong stance, appropriate in projects handling sensitive data. If this were looser, it could allow an override, but evidently they chose safety first.

**IF_HIGH_IMPACT** | ASK_USER\\
**Interpretation:** If the requested action will have **high impact** on the system -- meaning a large-scale change or something potentially disruptive (e.g., wiping a database, overhauling a core module, or any change that could significantly affect users or other parts of the system) -- the AI should pause and get user confirmation before proceeding. It will explain the potential high impact and ensure the user really wants to do this.\
**Why Useful:** This is about caution with big changes. Even if something isn't a security risk per se, high-impact changes can cause downtime or irreversible effects. For example, deleting a bunch of data or refactoring authentication logic could lock users out if done wrong. By asking the user, the AI ensures the user is aware of the stakes and explicitly okay with going ahead. It reduces the chance of an "oops" moment on major actions.\
**Extra setting examples:** Not every project includes a check like this, but it shows a careful approach. If omitted, the AI might attempt huge changes whenever asked, possibly catching the user off guard. By requiring a nod from the user, they add a human sanity check for actions that could be game-changers in the system.

**IF_CODE_DOCS_CONFLICT** | ASK_USER\\
**Interpretation:** If the AI finds that **the code and the documentation are in conflict** (for example, if documentation says one thing but the actual code behaves differently), it should ask the user how to resolve this discrepancy before proceeding with further changes. This could happen during planning when the AI reviews context: perhaps a function's docstring claims it returns something, but the code returns something else. The AI will bring this up to the user.\
**Why Useful:** Code-documentation mismatches can lead to misunderstandings and errors. By flagging conflicts, the AI ensures they get addressed rather than perpetuated. The user can clarify which source is correct or if the docs simply need updating. This check helps maintain the integrity of both code and docs moving forward -- the AI won't blindly trust outdated docs nor ignore them; it will explicitly reconcile them with user input.\
**Extra setting examples:** One alternative might be to always trust code over docs (or vice versa) without asking, but that risks either overriding correct documentation or following something outdated. By asking, the AI avoids assumptions. This aligns with earlier global rules (like `IF_CODE_AGENT_CONFIG_CONFLICT`) where the AI tries to keep code and config/docs in sync by consulting the user when they diverge.

**IF_DOCS_OUTDATED** | ASK_USER\\
**Interpretation:** If it appears that some **documentation is outdated** (not just conflicting, but clearly behind the current state of the code or requirements), the AI should ask the user how to proceed. For instance, maybe the user story or requirements doc hasn't been updated in a while and doesn't reflect recent changes -- the AI will notice this and bring it up.\
**Why Useful:** Outdated documentation can be as bad as no documentation, since it misleads. By catching this, the AI offers a chance to correct the docs as part of the upcoming work or separately. It could be that the user forgot to update a spec or that a feature changed during development; either way, highlighting it allows the team to fix the knowledge base. It ultimately helps keep documentation accurate if the user chooses to address it (manually or by instructing the AI to update it).\
**Extra setting examples:** The AI could theoretically try to update obviously outdated docs on its own, but that might require confirmation of intent. Here they explicitly require asking the user. It shows respect for documentation as something that might need separate consideration or human input, rather than the AI unilaterally editing long-form docs without context.

**IF_DOCS_INCONSISTENT** | ASK_USER\\
**Interpretation:** If the documentation itself is internally **inconsistent** -- say two documents or sections contradict each other, or the style/terminology isn't uniform -- the AI will ask the user what to do about it. This is similar to conflicts, but specifically within the docs realm.\
**Why Useful:** Consistent documentation is important for clarity. If one guide says one thing and another guide says the opposite, users and developers can get confused. The AI pointing this out allows the user to decide which is correct or if a rewrite is needed. This likely comes into play when the AI is reviewing docs as part of planning or alignment phases, helping maintain a single source of truth in documentation.\
**Extra setting examples:** As with outdated docs, the AI could try to fix inconsistencies, but without guidance it may pick the wrong resolution. By involving the user, they ensure the fix aligns with the actual intended behavior or policy. Some projects might not have this check at all (leaving doc inconsistencies to human documentation teams), but including it shows how thorough these instructions are.

**IF_NO_TASKS** | ASK_USER\\
**Interpretation:** If the user invokes the `/agent` command but **provides no specific tasks** or the AI ends up with an empty to-do list (perhaps the user's request was blank or too vague to generate tasks), the AI should ask the user for clarification. Essentially, "You activated action mode, but I don't actually have any concrete task to do -- what would you like me to do?"\
**Why Useful:** It handles cases of user error or misunderstanding. Maybe the user typed the command without details, or the AI parsed nothing actionable from it. Instead of silently doing nothing or guessing, it will prompt the user. This check ensures that an action session always has a purpose and prevents the AI from just idling or timing out in confusion.\
**Extra setting examples:** If this were not present, the AI might simply end the conversation or do nothing, which could confuse the user. By explicitly asking, it provides a better UX (user experience), prompting the user to provide tasks or to realize they need to format their request properly.

**IF_NO_TASKS_AFTER_COMMAND** | PROPOSE_NEXT_STEPS\\
**Interpretation:** This is a subtle but important scenario: if **after** processing the user's command or initial instructions there are still no concrete tasks (perhaps the user's issue got resolved by discussion or it turns out no changes are needed), the AI will **propose next steps** instead of just finishing silently. In practice, the AI might say, "It looks like there's nothing to do right now. Perhaps the next steps could be X, Y... would you like to proceed with any of those?"\
**Why Useful:** It keeps momentum and helps the user figure out what to do next. There are cases where the user's request might resolve to "no action needed" -- for example, the user might ask the AI to check something and it finds everything is already up-to-date. Instead of stopping, the AI will suggest a plan forward (maybe improvements or optional tasks) to ensure the user isn't left hanging. This makes the AI more proactive and helpful.\
**Extra setting examples:** If set differently, the AI might simply report "No tasks" and end the action, which could be fine but less helpful. By proposing next steps, the AI acts a bit like a project manager, always offering something productive to do, which can be valuable especially if the user is unsure what to ask for next.

**IF_UNABLE_TO_FULFILL** | PROPOSE_ALTERNATIVE\\
**Interpretation:** If the AI determines it **cannot fulfill** the request as given (perhaps due to limitations of the tech stack, missing dependencies, or the request being beyond what the AI can do), it will propose an alternative solution or approach to the user. Rather than just saying "I can't do that," it will suggest something it *can* do that might satisfy the user's needs or at least partially address the problem.\
**Why Useful:** This makes the AI resilient and user-friendly. For example, if a user asks the AI to implement a feature that is impossible due to platform restrictions, the AI might suggest a workaround or a different feature that achieves a similar result. This way, the user still gets value from the interaction instead of a dead-end "no." It helps keep progress going even when the original path is blocked.\
**Extra setting examples:** Without this, the AI might just fail or refuse the task, leaving the user with no solution. The alternative-proposing behavior ensures the AI always tries to be constructive. Some systems might instead escalate to a human or log a failure in such cases, but here the AI itself tries to solve the problem by changing the approach if needed.

**IF_TOO_COMPLEX** | PROPOSE_ALTERNATIVE\\
**Interpretation:** If the requested task or solution is **too complex** -- meaning it would be overly complicated to implement or perhaps beyond the AI's reliable capability in one go -- the AI will propose an alternative approach that is simpler or more feasible. Essentially, it's saying "That plan is extremely complex; how about we try a different route or break it down?"\
**Why Useful:** This prevents the AI from diving into a highly complex implementation that might fail or produce low-quality results. By suggesting a simpler alternative, the AI keeps the project within manageable scope. For example, if asked to develop an entire sub-module with many uncertainties in one step, the AI might instead propose a series of smaller steps or a simpler version of the feature first. This improves success rate and maintainability.\
**Extra setting examples:** If not included, the AI might attempt something beyond its depth, possibly getting stuck or timing out. Alternatively, one could have the AI simply ask the user for permission to simplify (instead of just proposing a new plan). But since they've used the same **PROPOSE_ALTERNATIVE** action, the AI will actively put forward a revised plan for user approval, which is a proactive stance.

**IF_TOO_MANY_FILES** | CHUNK_AND_PHASE\\
**Interpretation:** If the action would involve changing **too many files at once**, the AI should break the work into smaller **chunks or phases** rather than tackling everything in one go. "CHUNK_AND_PHASE" implies the AI will split the task into multiple sequential phases, each handling a subset of files, and likely execute them one by one (possibly requiring approval at each phase).\
**Why Useful:** Working on a very large number of files in one shot can be risky -- it's harder to keep track of all changes, review them, and ensure consistency. By chunking the work, the AI reduces complexity in each phase and lowers the chance of mistakes or overwhelming the context window (AI's short-term memory). For example, if implementing a sweeping change across 50 files, the AI might propose doing it in 3 phases, each covering ~15-20 files, so the user can verify step by step. This leads to more controlled, reviewable progress.\
**Extra setting examples:** The threshold for "too many" isn't explicitly given, but the AI will judge it. In other configurations, the AI might try to do everything in one phase regardless, which could be fine for small projects but not large ones. This rule suggests the project could get large, so they preemptively ensure the AI doesn't bite off more than it can chew.

**IF_TOO_MANY_CHANGES** | CHUNK_AND_PHASE\\
**Interpretation:** Similarly, if a single phase would entail **too many changes** overall (even if not file-count specific, perhaps a huge diff or very extensive modifications), the AI should split the work into multiple phases. It's a general safeguard to not overload one execution with excessive breadth or complexity of changes.\
**Why Useful:** Breaking down big changes into incremental ones helps in testing, reviewing, and isolating issues. For instance, a user might request a broad refactor touching logic across the app. Instead of doing it all at once (which could produce hundreds of changes and potential bugs), the AI might divide it into staged refactors. This way, after each phase, tests can run and ensure things still work, which is much safer.\
**Extra setting examples:** This goes hand in hand with the files rule, painting a picture that the AI will automatically manage large tasks in pieces. Not all AI systems do this; often they'll try everything in one go. The presence of these rules indicates an emphasis on reliability and perhaps working within the AI's token/context limits. If someone wanted the AI to attempt everything at once (maybe for speed and if the AI has very large context windows), they could disable these chunking rules.

**IF_RATE_LIMITED** | ALERT_USER\\
**Interpretation:** If during its operation the AI hits a **rate limit** (for example, an external API or resource it's using says "slow down" or "too many requests"), the AI should alert the user about this situation. In practice, this likely means informing the user that it has to pause or cannot complete a part of the task right now due to rate limiting.\
**Why Useful:** The user might not realize that the AI or its tools are being throttled by some service. By alerting, the user is made aware of the delay or limitation. For instance, if the AI needs to make a series of calls to a code analysis API and it hits a request-per-minute cap, it should tell the user it needs to wait or that the action will be slower. This transparency helps the user understand any unexpected slowdowns or partial results.\
**Extra setting examples:** The AI could theoretically try to automatically wait and retry (and it probably will), but alerting the user is polite and useful. An alternative approach could be "IF_RATE_LIMITED: RETRY_LATER" where the AI would schedule itself to resume after some time, but since continuous operation might not be possible without user in the loop, simply alerting the user is a sensible approach.

**IF_API_FAILURE** | ALERT_USER\\
**Interpretation:** If an external **API call fails** (e.g., a network error, or an external service returns an error), the AI should promptly inform the user. This could occur if the AI is leveraging some tool or external service as part of its workflow (like a package manager, a testing service, etc.) and that service is unreachable or returned an error.\
**Why Useful:** It ensures the user knows that a part of the automated process didn't succeed, which might affect the outcome. For instance, if the AI tries to run `snyk` for a security audit and the snyk service is down or the command fails, the AI shouldn't silently ignore it -- it should tell the user "the security scan couldn't be completed due to an API failure." This way, the user is aware of any gaps in the process and can decide to retry or proceed with caution.\
**Extra setting examples:** In some systems, the AI might attempt multiple retries or fallback to an alternative method on API failure. The config here doesn't specify retries, just to alert. Possibly, the AI will try again or propose an alternative manually, but at minimum the user won't be left in the dark. This is important for trust and completeness of the agent's report.

**IF_TIMEOUT** | ALERT_USER\\
**Interpretation:** If any operation **times out** (takes too long and is aborted), the AI should alert the user about it. Timeouts could happen during lengthy tasks -- perhaps running tests took too long or a build hung, or even the AI's own reasoning could exceed some limit.\
**Why Useful:** A timeout means the AI did not get a result for something it attempted. Notifying the user prevents misunderstanding; otherwise the user might think the AI finished when in fact part of the process was cut short. For example, if executing a heavy test suite times out, the AI would say "I couldn't run all tests within the time limit." The user can then decide whether to try again, increase limits, or proceed despite not fully completing that step.\
**Extra setting examples:** If not flagged, timeouts might lead to partial or inconsistent states without anyone knowing. By design, this agent errs on the side of transparency and caution. Some might program the AI to automatically retry once on timeout, but eventually it should inform the user, as done here, to decide the next course of action.

**IF_UNEXPECTED_ERROR** | ALERT_USER\\
**Interpretation:** If **any unexpected error** occurs that isn't covered by the other specific conditions, the AI will alert the user. This is a catch-all for miscellaneous exceptions or failures -- for example, if the AI encounters a bug in its own code execution environment, or an internal error like running out of memory, it should report that.\
**Why Useful:** It ensures no error goes unnoticed. Even if something happens that the designers didn't explicitly predict, the AI is instructed to not continue silently or crash without explanation. By informing the user, it invites either a retry or a different approach with the user's guidance. This is crucial for debugging the AI's process or for the user to understand why the AI couldn't complete a request.\
**Extra setting examples:** It's basically standard to have a fallback "report error" behavior. Without this, the AI might just stop responding or give a generic apology. Here, presumably, it will provide any details it can about what went wrong. This is akin to a well-designed system raising an exception to the user level for visibility.

**IF_UNSUPPORTED_REQUEST** | ALERT_USER\\
**Interpretation:** If the user's request is **unsupported** -- meaning it falls outside what the AI or the system is designed to handle -- the AI should alert the user. "Unsupported request" might include asking the AI to do something that isn't in its capability set or not allowed by policy (for example, "please design me a logo" when it's only a coding agent, or asking it to perform tasks that violate usage guidelines).\
**Why Useful:** It cleanly communicates boundaries. By alerting the user that their request cannot be fulfilled (instead of trying and failing poorly or ignoring parts of it), the user gets immediate feedback about scope. This helps manage expectations and guide user queries into the domain the AI can handle.\
**Extra setting examples:** They could have configured the AI to attempt some partial fulfillment or use external plugins for unsupported tasks, but since it's not, an alert is appropriate. This likely ties into system policies about not doing tasks outside its role. The alert could also possibly suggest what *is* supported, though not explicitly stated, but at least the user knows to rephrase or stop that line of inquiry.

**IF_UNSUPPORTED_FILE_TYPE** | ALERT_USER\\
**Interpretation:** If the user asks the AI to work with a **file type that isn't supported** (for example, maybe trying to generate code for a language or format this agent isn't set up to handle), the AI will alert the user that it cannot handle that file type. For instance, if the stack is Python/JS and the user says "edit this Rust file," the AI would flag that as unsupported.\
**Why Useful:** This prevents the AI from either attempting something it's not equipped for (which could produce nonsense or low-quality output) or quietly ignoring the request. The user is clearly informed that the requested operation is outside the configured technology stack. It helps steer the user back to supported technologies (like focusing on the frameworks and languages the project uses).\
**Extra setting examples:** The supported file types come from the tech stack defined earlier (Python, TypeScript, etc.). If this were not set, the AI might attempt to do its best with any file, possibly with poor results or violating the project constraints. With it, the AI is essentially constrained to not venture beyond known territory, which maintains project consistency.

**IF_UNSUPPORTED_LANGUAGE** | ALERT_USER\\
**Interpretation:** If the user requests code or functionality in a programming **language that isn't supported** by this project (or not part of the chosen stack), the AI will alert them. For example, if asked to write a module in Java whereas the backend is Python, the AI will say it cannot proceed with that language.\
**Why Useful:** It ensures the project remains within its intended tech stack. This is crucial for maintainability -- introducing a new language unexpectedly could be a huge issue. By refusing such requests, the AI keeps the codebase consistent (Python for backend, TypeScript for frontend in this case). It also educates the user if they weren't aware of the stack limitations.\
**Extra setting examples:** One could allow a new language if truly necessary by not having such a check, but this config intentionally forbids it unless possibly the "introduce new tech" process (with approval) is followed. The alert approach is immediate. If a future need arises to add a language, ideally the config and stack would be updated first rather than a user casually requesting it.

**IF_UNSUPPORTED_FRAMEWORK** | ALERT_USER\\
**Interpretation:** If the user's request involves using a **framework that is not supported** or not among the chosen ones (e.g., asking to add an Angular frontend when the stack is React, or use Flask instead of Django), the AI will alert the user that this framework isn't supported.\
**Why Useful:** Like languages, frameworks are a key part of the stack. Mixing in an unsupported framework can cause inconsistency and bloat. This rule acts as a guardrail, ensuring the AI doesn't pull in a random framework because a user unfamiliar with the project suggests it. It keeps development aligned with the original architectural choices.\
**Extra setting examples:** If the team decided to pivot frameworks, they would update the [STACK] configuration rather than just instruct the AI in a single command. So this check enforces that discipline. Without it, the AI might attempt to use the new framework (maybe poorly integrated) or just create confusion. By alerting, it triggers a discussion or a deliberate config change before proceeding with that approach.

**IF_UNSUPPORTED_LIBRARY** | ALERT_USER\\
**Interpretation:** If the user asks to use or install a **library that's not supported** (perhaps one that violates the "prefer well-known libraries" rules or is outside the policy like a closed-source library, or simply not needed given the stack), the AI will alert them. For example, if the user says "use X proprietary SDK" and that conflicts with open-source policy, the AI will refuse unless that policy is changed.\
**Why Useful:** This prevents introducing dependencies that could be problematic (unlicensed, insecure, unmaintained, or just outside project conventions). It reinforces earlier global rules about preferring certain libraries. The user gets feedback that the library choice is not acceptable under current guidelines.\
**Extra setting examples:** The specifics of "unsupported" might come from rules like "no closed source" or popularity thresholds (like fewer than 1000 GitHub stars, as mentioned in the global config). The AI will likely cite those reasons when alerting. An alternative approach could be automatically suggesting a more acceptable library ("Library X is not allowed, but Library Y is a good alternative"), though that's not explicitly stated here. Either way, the user is made aware of the issue rather than the AI just ignoring the instruction.

**IF_UNSUPPORTED_DATABASE** | ALERT_USER\\
**Interpretation:** If the request involves a **database technology that isn't supported** (say the project uses PostgreSQL and the user asks to use MySQL or MongoDB outside the RAG context), the AI will alert the user that this isn't allowed.\
**Why Useful:** Database choices are foundational. Introducing a different database engine could require huge changes and goes against the decided stack (which in this case is Postgres with some Mongo use for RAG). This check ensures the AI sticks to the chosen database systems. If a user unfamiliar with the backend suggests using an unsupported DB, the AI will politely refuse.\
**Extra setting examples:** In some projects, multiple databases might be allowed, but they have a clearly defined one here. If they ever wanted to add another (like add MySQL for some reason), that would be added to the config. This rule basically says "don't spontaneously use a DB that we haven't planned for." It's a consistency and supportability measure.

**IF_UNSUPPORTED_TOOL** | ALERT_USER\\
**Interpretation:** If the user asks the AI to use a **tool that isn't supported or available** in the development environment (for example, a specific CI tool, build tool, or testing framework not in the config), the AI will alert them. "Tool" can be broad, but likely means anything like a CI service, deployment tool, or perhaps a dev utility that's outside the approved list.\
**Why Useful:** This keeps the development pipeline and environment standardized. If the project uses GitHub Actions and someone asks "set up a Jenkins pipeline," that would trigger this rule. It avoids fragmenting the tooling or adding things that aren't integrated. By alerting, the user is informed that the request doesn't fit the current setup.\
**Extra setting examples:** As with others, if the team decides to adopt a new tool, they'd update the config. This dynamic ensures that the AI is always aligned with a single source of truth about tooling. Without this, the AI might attempt to fulfill the request in a vacuum, which could result in wasted effort or incompatible setups.

**IF_UNSUPPORTED_SERVICE** | ALERT_USER\\
**Interpretation:** If the user suggests using an **external service or platform that's not supported**, the AI will alert them. For instance, deploying to a cloud not listed (the config suggests they plan to use a specific hosting/Coolify, etc.), or using an API service that isn't approved, would fall here.\
**Why Useful:** External services often require accounts, integrations, and aren't trivial to swap. If the project is set up for one cloud provider or third-party service and the user tries to use another, that could derail the process. This rule acts as a contract: "We stick to the services we've planned for." It prevents one-off requests from introducing new dependencies on services that haven't been vetted.\
**Extra setting examples:** For a fully locked-down environment, this is great. Alternatively, the config could allow some flexibility or have a list of allowed services. Here it's binary: if not explicitly supported (like Stripe for billing, Snyk for security, etc., which are mentioned in config), then it's a no-go without further discussion.

**IF_UNSUPPORTED_PLATFORM** | ALERT_USER\\
**Interpretation:** If the user wants to target a **platform that isn't supported**, the AI will alert them. Platform might mean operating system, device, or distribution channel. For example, if asked to build a Windows desktop app (`WINUI_EXECUTABLE`) while the plan defers that, or a native mobile app when only web is targeted, the AI would flag it.\
**Why Useful:** This maintains focus on the intended delivery platforms (web and mobile web, per the earlier config). It prevents expending effort on platforms that the team has decided to postpone or not support. It's also a reality check for the user -- sometimes a user might request a feature assuming multi-platform support, and the AI will remind them that's not currently in scope.\
**Extra setting examples:** We saw earlier they explicitly deferred platforms like SWIFT and KOTLIN apps, so this rule operationalizes that by making the AI refuse those unless plans change. Another approach might be to accept the request but create a ticket or note that it's out of scope. But here they chose to flat-out alert, likely to prompt a conversation or decision (such as reprioritizing the roadmap or clarifying the request).

**IF_UNSUPPORTED_ENV** | ALERT_USER\\
**Interpretation:** If the request involves an **environment that's not supported** -- perhaps a deployment or runtime environment outside the ones intended (like trying to run the app on Windows if it's only meant for Linux servers, or using an unsupported Python interpreter or Node version), the AI will alert the user.\
**Why Useful:** "Environment" could cover a lot: OS, container vs serverless, etc. This rule ensures the AI doesn't do work that won't run in the target environment. For example, if someone asked to use a feature that only works on a certain cloud environment not in use, or to rely on a system path that wouldn't exist in containerized deployments, the AI should push back. It's a protective measure to keep solutions environment-compatible.\
**Extra setting examples:** If this wasn't specified, the AI might proceed and generate something that later fails in the real environment. With it, any environment mismatch becomes a discussion point. It complements earlier specific rules like platform and service -- essentially covering any other "unsupported" category not spelled out. It all contributes to keeping the AI's output within the boundaries of what the system is set up for.

[BEFORE_ACTION_PLANNING] -- Task Planning and Approval Strategy
---------------------------------------------------------------

*This section dictates how the AI should plan and present the work **before** coding begins. It covers prioritizing tasks, handling preemptive issues, communicating the plan to the user, and requiring user approval.*

**PRIORITIZE_TASK_LIST** | TRUE\\
**Interpretation:** The AI will actively **prioritize and order the task list** before executing. If the user provides multiple tasks (or if the AI identifies multiple sub-tasks), it won't necessarily do them in the given order blindly -- instead, it will sort or rearrange tasks so that the most critical or prerequisite tasks happen first.\
**Why Useful:** This ensures an optimal execution sequence. For example, if task B depends on task A being done first (perhaps database setup before API endpoint), the AI will recognize that and reorder accordingly. Or if one task addresses a security issue and others are feature additions, it might prioritize the security fix first. By doing this planning, the AI avoids situations where a later task might force redoing an earlier task because the order was wrong.\
**Extra setting examples:** If set to **FALSE**, the AI would follow the user's task order verbatim, which might be fine if the user is meticulous, but could lead to inefficiency if not. Some configurations might even allow the AI to drop low-priority tasks in favor of high-impact ones if time is limited, but here it specifically says prioritize, not eliminate. The true/false toggle simply decides whether the AI has the freedom to reorder for logical sense.

**PREEMPT_FOR** | SECURITY_ISSUES; FAILING_BUILDS_TESTS_LINTERS; BLOCKING_INCONSISTENCIES\\
**Interpretation:** This setting tells the AI that certain issues should **preempt the normal plan** -- meaning if any of these are detected, they take immediate priority before continuing with the user's requested tasks. Specifically, if there are **security issues** present, or if the build/tests/linters are failing, or if there are **blocking inconsistencies** (likely major contradictions or mismatches in the project that would hinder progress), the AI should address those first (essentially pausing or reordering the plan to fix these).\
**Why Useful:** It ensures critical problems get fixed **ahead of new feature development**. For instance, if the CI is red (tests failing) or a known vulnerability exists, those could jeopardize any new changes or the stability of the project. By preempting for security or broken builds, the AI helps maintain a stable foundation. "Blocking inconsistencies" might refer to things like data schema mismatches or environment issues that would block new work until resolved. Handling them first prevents compounding issues.\
**Extra setting examples:** This is somewhat akin to a triage system. Some projects might extend this list (maybe preempt for performance issues above a threshold if that's urgent, etc.), or narrow it. They chose the top essentials: security and build stability. It reflects a philosophy: never move forward while the house is on fire. If these were not preemptive, the AI might add new features on a shaky base, which is undesirable.

**PREEMPTION_REASON_REQUIRED** | TRUE\\
**Interpretation:** When the AI does preempt the normal flow (due to any condition above), it must provide a **reason** for doing so. In practice, when the AI communicates the adjusted plan to the user, it will explicitly say *why* it's tackling something out of the original scope or order -- e.g., "I detected failing tests, so I will address that first."\
**Why Useful:** Transparency. The user might be surprised if the AI suddenly starts doing an unrelated fix instead of the requested feature; by requiring a reason, the user stays informed. This builds trust, as the user sees the AI isn't going rogue but is intentionally handling urgent issues. It also forces the AI to double-check that it's indeed valid to preempt (since it has to articulate the reason, it won't do it frivolously).\
**Extra setting examples:** If false, the AI might still preempt but without clearly telling the user why, leading to confusion. In some environments, maybe reasons are always given by convention, but explicitly requiring it ensures no corner-cutting. It's a nice touch for effective collaboration between AI and user.

**POST_TO_CHAT** | COMPACT_CHANGE_INTENT; GOAL; FILES; RISKS; VALIDATION_REQUIREMENTS; REASONING\\
**Interpretation:** This specifies what information the AI should **include in the plan it presents to the user in the chat**before execution. The AI will post a summary containing: a **compact change intent** (a brief statement of what it plans to do), the overall **goal** of the changes, the list of **files** it expects to modify or create, the **risks** it anticipates or things to watch out for, any **validation requirements** (like "all tests must pass" or specific tests to focus on), and its internal **reasoning** behind the plan.\
**Why Useful:** This ensures the user gets a comprehensive yet concise overview of the proposed action **before** it happens. By seeing the files and risks, the user can spot if something looks off ("Wait, why edit that file?" or "That risk is unacceptable"). The reasoning part gives insight into the AI's thought process, which helps the user trust and verify the approach. In essence, this is the AI's way of saying, "Here's what I plan to do and why, does that sound good?"\
**Extra setting examples:** Not every system would include all these elements. They specifically want a lot of detail (files, risks, etc.) likely because this is a coding context where such specifics matter. A more lightweight system might only share a goal and ask to proceed. Here, it's almost like a mini design review before coding. The "compact_change_intent" suggests brevity for the high-level summary, and then other items flesh it out. It's a well-structured template for user approval messages.

**AWAIT_APPROVAL** | TRUE\\
**Interpretation:** After posting the above plan to the chat, the AI **must wait for the user's approval** before actually executing the changes. It won't proceed to coding (Action Runtime phase) until the user gives an explicit go-ahead.\
**Why Useful:** This is a critical safety step. It allows the user to review the plan and either approve, modify, or cancel it. This way, if the AI misunderstood the request or the user has second thoughts, they catch it before any code is written. It's analogous to a human developer saying "I'll do X, Y, Z -- does that sound good?" in a team meeting before starting work. Especially when the AI might suggest additional changes (like refactors or fixes), user confirmation is important to ensure alignment.\
**Extra setting examples:** If this were false, the AI would assume its plan is fine and start coding immediately, which is faster but riskier. In some rapid prototyping scenarios, one might skip explicit approval for speed, but in a collaborative environment it's safer to require it. They do allow a potential override below, indicating some flexibility, but default behavior is to pause for approval.

**OVERRIDE_APPROVAL_WITH_USER_REQUEST** | TRUE\\
**Interpretation:** This setting allows that if the **user's request explicitly or implicitly indicates they want no approval step**, the AI can skip waiting for confirmation. In other words, if the user says something like "Go ahead and do it directly" or if the context makes it clear that immediate action is desired, the AI doesn't need to ask "Should I proceed?" again.\
**Why Useful:** It adds flexibility for more advanced users or cases where the extra confirmation would be redundant. For example, if a user in a single message provides a plan and effectively says "please implement this," it would be annoying for the AI to rephrase the same plan and ask for approval. This setting lets the AI recognize when the approval is already implicit in the user's command (maybe the user says "/agent please fix the tests and then add feature X -- you have my pre-approval").\
**Extra setting examples:** If this were false, the AI would always ask for approval no matter what, which could slow things down and frustrate users who intentionally combined steps. True means the AI needs a bit of judgment: it must detect a user's intent to skip formalities. It's a more user-friendly approach in practice, making the system less rigid while still generally safe.

**MAXIMUM_PHASES** | 3\\
**Interpretation:** If the AI needs to break the work into multiple phases (chunks of work) -- like when handling many changes or iterative improvements -- it should use at most **3 phases** for a single action session. This caps the number of sequential sub-sessions it will split the task into.\
**Why Useful:** It limits complexity and time. By saying "no more than 3," they ensure the AI doesn't go into an endless loop of "phase 4, phase 5, ...". It encourages the AI to either complete the work within three iterations or present remaining work for another round or day. This is likely chosen because beyond 3 phases without human intervention, the process might become too convoluted or hard for the user to track.\
**Extra setting examples:** They chose 3 as a reasonable upper bound. Some might set it to 2 for quicker tasks, or higher if they expect extremely complex tasks (but too high could be impractical). If the AI truly can't finish in 3 phases, it probably should come back for fresh instructions or break the user's request into separate actions. So this number helps maintain a balance between thoroughness and manageability.

**CACHE_PRECHANGE_STATE_FOR_ROLLBACK** | TRUE\\
**Interpretation:** Before the AI makes any changes to the codebase, it will **cache (save) the current state** so that it can rollback if needed. Essentially, the AI will take a snapshot (for example, saving copies of files or a git commit hash) *pre-change*. If something goes wrong or if the user later requests a rollback, the AI has the exact baseline to revert to.\
**Why Useful:** It provides a safety net. If during validation or user review something is off, they can undo the changes reliably. This is akin to creating a "restore point." It's especially useful in an automated environment where the AI might otherwise lose track of what the original state was. By caching it, the AI can always compare and revert changes exactly.\
**Extra setting examples:** If this were false, rollbacks become harder (the AI would have to rely on memory or version control if integrated). True suggests maybe the AI will either utilize version control commits or keep an internal diff. It underlines a cautious approach: always have a way to go back. Not every system automates this, but it's very valuable for an AI making changes autonomously.

**PREDICT_CONFLICTS** | TRUE\\
**Interpretation:** The AI will attempt to **predict conflicts** ahead of time during planning. This could refer to merge conflicts (if multiple branches or pending changes exist) or logical conflicts between new changes and existing code. In planning, the AI might say, "I foresee that modifying these two modules could conflict with each other or with current code in main branch."\
**Why Useful:** By predicting conflicts early, the AI can adjust the plan to avoid them or at least warn the user. For example, it might stagger changes to avoid editing the same file in two separate phases simultaneously. Or it might identify that a variable name it plans to use is already used elsewhere, to avoid a naming collision. This proactive analysis leads to smoother execution with fewer mid-course corrections.\
**Extra setting examples:** Many AI implementations would only react to conflicts once they occur (like when trying to commit changes). Predicting them is extra smart -- it's like the AI has a mini static analysis or awareness of parallel work. If false, the AI would handle conflicts in a reactive way, possibly causing delays. True means it will try to foresee and mention them, which the user can appreciate as it shows foresight.

**SUGGEST_ALTERNATIVES_IF_UNABLE** | TRUE\\
**Interpretation:** If during planning the AI concludes it is **unable to fulfill** the request exactly as asked (due to limitations or unclear instructions), it will automatically **suggest alternatives** to the user, rather than just stopping. This is very much in line with the earlier `IF_UNABLE_TO_FULFILL` check, but here it's codified as a general planning principle.\
**Why Useful:** It ensures that even if the original goal is out of reach, the AI provides a fallback plan. For example, "I can't integrate Service X because we don't have an API key, but I could mock that functionality or use Service Y instead." This keeps the momentum and demonstrates problem-solving. It's essentially an explicit directive for the AI to be solution-oriented and not give up at the planning stage.\
**Extra setting examples:** If set false, the AI might just throw its hands up when something isn't doable and wait for user input. True makes the AI more autonomous in finding a second-best route. This is very user-friendly. It aligns with the project's general attitude of always offering a constructive path forward.

[ACTION_RUNTIME] -- Execution-Time Coding Guidelines
----------------------------------------------------

*This section sets rules for the AI **during the coding phase** itself. It guides how the AI writes code: enforcing best practices, documentation, tool usage, and ensuring any new code integrates smoothly with the existing system.*

**ALLOW_UNSCOPED_ACTIONS** | FALSE\\
**Interpretation:** The AI is **not allowed to take actions outside of the agreed scope** of tasks. "Unscoped actions" means doing things that were not part of the plan or user request. By setting this to false, the AI must confine itself strictly to the tasks and plan that were confirmed in the planning phase, without straying or adding extra changes on its own initiative (unless those were covered by the pre-checks and approvals).\
**Why Useful:** It reins in the AI from going on tangents. For example, if the AI notices an unrelated issue while coding, with this rule it shouldn't spontaneously fix it unless it's within scope or it goes back to ask first. This prevents unintended side effects. It's essentially about discipline: the AI sticks to what was decided. This is especially important in a big codebase -- you wouldn't want an AI silently altering something unrelated "for good measure" and potentially introducing bugs.\
**Extra setting examples:** If this were true, the AI would have more freedom to make opportunistic improvements or changes outside the immediate task list. Some might allow that in a very autonomous scenario, but the risk is unpredictable changes. They chose to disallow it, meaning any additional work (beyond minor necessary adjustments) should be treated as a separate task with its own planning/approval.

**FORCE_BEST_PRACTICES** | TRUE\\
**Interpretation:** The AI must **apply best practices at all times** when writing code. This means it won't knowingly write sloppy, insecure, or non-idiomatic code even if the user's original codebase or request doesn't explicitly demand it. It will enforce high standards in areas like code style, error handling, security (like using prepared statements, validating inputs), performance (efficient algorithms when applicable), etc.\
**Why Useful:** It guarantees a baseline of quality for all AI contributions. The AI essentially acts like a senior engineer who will not compromise on fundamentals. For instance, if writing a SQL query, it will automatically parameterize inputs (to avoid SQL injection), if writing Python, it will follow PEP8 style guidelines and structure code cleanly. This reduces technical debt and ensures the AI's output is production-grade by default.\
**Extra setting examples:** Had this been false, the AI might cut corners for speed or simplicity, especially if not explicitly told otherwise. By forcing best practices, they ensure consistency with the project's "professional" vibe. It aligns with earlier rules (like pre-checks for best practice violations) -- now during actual coding, the AI will implement those good practices proactively.

**ANNOTATE_CODE** | EXTENSIVELY\\
**Interpretation:** The AI is instructed to add **extensive comments/annotations** to the code it writes. "Extensively" implies more than just the occasional comment -- likely describing the purpose of classes and functions, complex logic, and rationale for important decisions in the code. The AI might include docstrings, inline comments for tricky sections, and explanatory notes for any non-obvious implementation.\
**Why Useful:** This makes the code far more maintainable and easier for humans to review. Comments act as the AI's on-the-spot explanation of what it's doing and why. For instance, if it writes a function, it might comment the expected inputs/outputs and any caveats; if it implements an algorithm, it will comment each step or the reasoning behind the approach. This is particularly helpful since the code is being generated by AI -- developers might be wary, but seeing thorough comments can instill confidence and ease understanding.\
**Extra setting examples:** Other possible values could be "MINIMALLY" (only comment when necessary) or "NONE" (no comments unless asked). They chose "EXTENSIVELY," showing they value clarity over brevity. It's a bit like having the AI also act as a teacher or documenter as it codes. One downside is it can make the code verbose, but they likely prefer that to cryptic code.

**SCAN_FOR_CONFLICTS** | PROGRESSIVELY\\
**Interpretation:** While writing code, the AI should **continuously scan for conflicts** -- meaning as it makes changes file by file or step by step, it keeps checking if its new changes conflict with existing code or with changes made in earlier steps. "Progressively" suggests it doesn't just wait until the very end to compile or run tests to find conflicts; it is actively looking out for them during the coding process.\
**Why Useful:** Catching conflicts early (progressively) means they can be resolved on the fly rather than piling up. For example, if in phase 1 it created a function and in phase 2 it's adding a similar function, it might realize a naming conflict or duplicate logic and adjust immediately. Or if two tasks planned happen to touch the same area, the AI can integrate them smoothly rather than produce two separate changes that clash. Ultimately, this leads to a smoother final integration and less chance of a mid-validation surprise like a merge conflict.\
**Extra setting examples:** If set to "at_end" or similar, the AI would only discover conflicts after everything is done, which can require backtracking. By doing it progressively, they ensure a more iterative conflict resolution. It pairs well with the idea of chunking phases: after each chunk, check for issues before moving on. It's a very thoughtful approach to multi-step changes.

**DONT_REPEAT_YOURSELF** | TRUE\\
**Interpretation:** The AI must follow the DRY (**Don't Repeat Yourself**) principle while coding. It should avoid writing duplicate or very similar code in multiple places. Instead, it should refactor or reuse existing code where possible. For example, if two functions share common logic, the AI should abstract that logic into one helper function rather than copy-pasting it.\
**Why Useful:** DRY is a core tenet of maintainable code. This setting ensures the AI doesn't inadvertently introduce redundancy -- something that could easily happen if it solves similar problems in different parts of the code without cross-checking. By enforcing DRY, the codebase remains cleaner, with each piece of knowledge or functionality having a single source of truth. It reduces bugs (fixing a bug in one place fixes it everywhere that code is used) and reduces bloat.\
**Extra setting examples:** This is either on or off typically. They have it on, which is expected for a high-quality codebase. If off, the AI might take shortcuts like duplicating a snippet for convenience. Given the AI can analyze the whole codebase, it's in a good position to follow DRY (like "hey, there's already a function for this"). This setting works hand in hand with the earlier pre-check "IF_REDUNDANT_CODE -> propose refactor" and the refactoring guidelines to eliminate redundancy.

**KEEP_IT_SIMPLE_STUPID** | ONLY_IF (NOT_SECURITY_RISK && REMAINS_SCALABLE, PERFORMANT, MAINTAINABLE)\\
**Interpretation:** This instructs the AI to follow the KISS (**Keep It Simple, Stupid**) principle -- **but only under certain conditions**. The AI should implement the simplest solution possible **as long as** doing so does not introduce a security risk and while ensuring the solution remains scalable, performant, and maintainable. In essence, favor simplicity unless simplicity would compromise important qualities. If the simplest approach would, say, be insecure or would not scale, then the AI should *not* take that "simple" shortcut.\
**Why Useful:** It balances simplicity with robustness. KISS is great because simple code is easier to understand and less prone to errors. However, naive simplicity can sometimes ignore critical needs like security (e.g., skipping encryption for simplicity would be bad) or scalability (e.g., using a quick fix that doesn't scale to multiple users). By adding those conditions, they ensure the AI doesn't over-simplify in a harmful way. The AI will default to simplicity, but it's allowed to introduce necessary complexity if required for safety and future-proofing.\
**Extra setting examples:** They essentially encoded a nuanced guideline rather than a binary. Another project might just say "Always KISS" without caveats, which could cause issues in edge cases. Or they might exclude some conditions. Here they explicitly listed security, scalability, performance, maintainability -- covering most quality aspects. It shows they want simple solutions but not at the expense of critical software qualities. It's quite a thoughtful rule that encourages judgement.

**MINIMIZE_NEW_TECH** | *Complex rule (see below)*

-   **DEFAULT:** TRUE

-   **EXCEPT IF:** SIGNIFICANT_BENEFIT && FULLY_COMPATIBLE && NO_MAJOR_BREAKING_CHANGES && SECURE && MAINTAINABLE && PERFORMANT

-   **THEN:** PROPOSE_NEW_TECH_AWAIT_APPROVAL

**Interpretation:** By default, the AI should **avoid introducing new technologies or external libraries** into the project. It should try to work with the existing stack and tools. However, there is an exception clause: if adopting a new technology would bring a **significant benefit** *and* it meets a stringent list of criteria (it's fully compatible with the current system, doesn't cause major breaking changes, and is secure, maintainable, and performant), then the AI is allowed to propose using this new tech -- but even then, it must **get user approval** before actually using it. In short, "Don't bring in new tech unless it's clearly worth it and safe, and even then, check with the user first."\
**Why Useful:** This prevents the AI from impulsively adding new frameworks, libraries, or tools just because it knows about them. Unchecked, an AI might think "hey, there's a library that does this" and pull it in, but that can bloat the project or conflict with other components. By minimizing new tech, the project stays simpler and avoids the pitfalls of dependency hell. The exception is sensible -- sometimes a new library really can save a ton of work or dramatically improve a feature. In those rare cases, as long as all due diligence checks (security, compatibility, etc.) pass, the AI can suggest it. Requiring approval ensures the human team agrees it's a good idea (they might have organizational reasons to avoid certain licenses, for example).\
**Extra setting examples:** A stricter setup might say never introduce new tech, period. A more lenient one might allow the AI to introduce new tech freely if it's beneficial, without approval (risky). This config strikes a middle ground, allowing innovation but with caution. It's akin to a change control board for tech stack changes -- the AI can't just sneak something in; it must justify it and get a sign-off.

**MAXIMIZE_EXISTING_TECH_UTILIZATION** | TRUE\\
**Interpretation:** The AI should always try to **use the capabilities of the existing tech stack to their fullest** before considering alternatives. This means if a feature can be built with the frameworks and libraries already in the project, the AI should do so rather than looking for new libraries or tools. Essentially, "make the most of what we already have."\
**Why Useful:** It encourages consistency and efficiency. Every new dependency or tech introduced has a cost (learning, maintenance, increased surface for bugs/security issues). By fully utilizing Django, React, etc., the AI might leverage built-in features or existing helper functions instead of importing something new. For instance, if asked to add an authentication feature, this rule nudges the AI to use Django's auth system (since it's already there) instead of pulling in a new auth library. This results in less redundancy and a more cohesive codebase.\
**Extra setting examples:** This complements MINIMIZE_NEW_TECH. It's basically the flip side: not only avoid new stuff, but really squeeze value from the current stuff. If false, the AI might be more prone to integrate external solutions even for problems the current stack could solve, which could lead to unnecessary complexity. True makes the AI act like an engineer who first asks, "Can we do this with what we already have?" -- which is usually a good practice.

**ENSURE_BACKWARD_COMPATIBILITY** | TRUE *(Major breaking changes require user approval)*\\
**Interpretation:** The AI must make sure that its changes **do not break backward compatibility** unless explicitly approved. "Backward compatibility" means existing functionalities, data, or APIs should continue to work after the change. If a change would be a "major breaking change" -- for example, altering a database schema in a way that old data becomes unreadable, or changing a public API endpoint's behavior -- the AI is either to avoid it or at least not finalize it without getting the user's approval to intentionally break compatibility.\
**Why Useful:** Projects often need to maintain support for existing users or data. This rule prevents the AI from introducing changes that would force a migration or cause older parts of the system to fail. It adds a layer of caution: the AI will think twice about doing anything that isn't backward compatible, and likely, if such a change is truly needed, it will flag it to the user (e.g., "This will break X, do we proceed?"). This preserves stability and trust --- e.g., you don't want an AI to rename a database column and suddenly the app can't read old records without a migration the user didn't plan for.\
**Extra setting examples:** If this were false, the AI might do sweeping changes more freely, which could be catastrophic if not managed. With it true, we can expect the AI to do things like deprecate old functions but not remove them outright, or add new parameters without removing old ones (ensuring old calls still work), etc. It's essentially coding with an eye on not breaking what's already been delivered.

**ENSURE_FORWARD_COMPATIBILITY** | TRUE\\
**Interpretation:** The AI should implement changes in a way that **anticipates future needs** and doesn't corner the project into a dead-end. "Forward compatibility" generally means designing systems so that future enhancements or expansions can be added without undue difficulty. In practice, the AI might choose more flexible approaches in code and data schemas. For example, saving data in a way that if new fields are added later it won't break, or writing code that can handle input it doesn't recognize gracefully (to allow future extensions).\
**Why Useful:** It's about future-proofing. By considering forward compatibility, the AI reduces the chances that today's implementation will have to be heavily refactored tomorrow to accommodate a new requirement. It's a bit forward-looking for an AI agent (since it doesn't know the future per se), but it likely will rely on general principles like extensible design, using configuration or metadata instead of hard-coding magic numbers, etc. It aligns with the product being in "PRE_RELEASE" -- they expect it to evolve, so they want minimal friction for future changes.\
**Extra setting examples:** Some might not emphasize this, focusing only on current requirements. But this team clearly values long-term maintainability. Forward compatibility can sometimes conflict with YAGNI ("You Aren't Gonna Need It" -- don't implement what's not needed yet), but I suspect the AI will balance this by not going overboard, just not doing narrow one-off hacks that would block extension. It's a guiding principle to remind the AI to keep designs general enough for anticipated growth.

**ENSURE_SECURITY_BEST_PRACTICES** | TRUE\\
**Interpretation:** While coding, the AI must adhere to **security best practices** throughout. This means things like validating inputs, sanitizing any data that goes to outputs (to prevent XSS, etc.), using secure communication (HTTPS, encryption) when applicable, handling secrets properly (not hardcoding keys, etc.), and generally following industry security guidelines for the tech in use.\
**Why Useful:** It provides an extra guarantee that the AI's output will be secure by default. Security is easy to overlook in routine development; by explicitly enumerating this, the AI will consciously include security checks and not leave obvious vulnerabilities. For example, if writing a file upload feature, it will consider checking file types and sizes to prevent malicious uploads. Or if storing passwords, it will ensure hashing is used. Having this as a constant requirement significantly reduces the risk of security holes in AI-generated code.\
**Extra setting examples:** This is part of a series of "ENSURE_*_BEST_PRACTICES" and essentially all set to TRUE, which shows they want a thorough application of all quality aspects. There's not much reason to ever set this false unless prototyping quickly in a sandbox, but for a real product, it's wise to keep it true.

**ENSURE_PERFORMANCE_BEST_PRACTICES** | TRUE\\
**Interpretation:** The AI should follow **performance best practices** as it implements solutions. That means it should write efficient code (both time and memory-wise) -- e.g., using appropriate algorithms, avoiding needless computations in loops, not doing N+1 database queries, leveraging caching when needed, etc., in line with known performance patterns for the stack (like using queryset efficiently in Django, using useMemo/useCallback appropriately in React, etc.).\
**Why Useful:** Performance issues can cripple user experience and scalability. By baking performance considerations in from the start, the AI's code is less likely to cause slowdowns. For instance, if asked to generate a report, the AI might choose to stream data or paginate rather than load it all into memory if it's large, because of this rule. Or it might consider complexity and choose a method that runs in O(n) instead of O(n^2) when possible. Over time, these choices add up to a much more responsive application.\
**Extra setting examples:** Again, they want a balanced approach -- not prematurely optimizing to the point of obfuscation (which could violate maintainability), but definitely not writing naive slow code. Typically, these best practices are well-known (like "don't select * then filter in memory, filter in the DB query"). This also suggests the AI might run some complexity estimates in its reasoning to ensure it isn't doing something that will be problematic at scale.

**ENSURE_MAINTAINABILITY_BEST_PRACTICES** | TRUE\\
**Interpretation:** The AI must ensure the code is **maintainable** -- meaning well-structured, modular, and clear. Best practices for maintainability include having clear function and variable names, breaking large functions into smaller ones, avoiding deeply nested logic when not needed, following SOLID principles (if applicable), writing tests (as reinforced later), and generally organizing code so that future developers (or the AI itself in future sessions) can easily understand and modify it.\
**Why Useful:** Maintainable code reduces long-term costs. If the AI dumps a giant monolithic function that works, that might solve the immediate problem but create headaches later. With this rule, the AI might instead refactor the solution into classes or smaller functions, add comments (which we know it will, extensively), and keep the project's code style consistent. Over time, a maintainable codebase means new features can be added quicker and bugs can be found and fixed with less effort.\
**Extra setting examples:** Essentially they're instructing the AI to act like a conscientious developer, not just code for the machine but code for humans too. Coupled with the documentation commands, it's clear they don't view AI as a one-off code generator, but part of a continuing team. No alternative setting is really desirable here; you always want maintainability if possible. The only trade-off might be, if performance or some quick hack was needed temporarily (then maybe bending maintainability), but generally those scenarios would still go through user approval given these rules.

**ENSURE_ACCESSIBILITY_BEST_PRACTICES** | TRUE\\
**Interpretation:** The AI should implement **accessibility best practices**, particularly relevant to the front-end (React) but also any UI or user-facing aspects of the system. This means ensuring web content is usable by people with disabilities: e.g., adding appropriate ARIA labels, making sure color contrasts are sufficient, keyboard navigability, alt text for images, proper form labels, etc. If generating any HTML or UI components, the AI should check them against accessibility guidelines (like WCAG).\
**Why Useful:** Accessibility is often overlooked, so having the AI keep it in mind ensures the product can be used by the widest audience and meets legal/ethical standards. For example, if the AI builds a custom button component, it will ensure it can be focused and activated via keyboard and has aria-label if it's just an icon. This also reduces future refactoring -- it's much easier to build accessibility in from the start than to retrofit it.\
**Extra setting examples:** This stands out because not all projects enforce accessibility unless it's user-facing product (which this is). They explicitly listed it, which is great. If set false, the AI might ignore a11y (and you'd end up with things like missing alt attributes, etc.). True means the AI may even prompt for missing alt text or pick sensible defaults, and ensure UI code is inclusive. It's essentially an automated quality control on an important facet of UX.

**ENSURE_I18N_BEST_PRACTICES** | TRUE\\
**Interpretation:** The AI must follow **internationalization (i18n) best practices** while coding. This means any user-facing text should be externalized to the locale files (as configured under KEYS_STORE, etc.), the code should not assume a single locale (like not hard-coding date or number formats), and overall be ready for multiple languages. It also includes writing code that can handle different character sets, text directions (if applicable), pluralization rules, etc., using proper frameworks or libraries.\
**Why Useful:** They indicated the product should be i18n-ready from the get-go. By enforcing i18n now, they won't have a huge task later to sift through and externalize strings or fix locale issues. For example, the AI will put any English strings into the YAML keys store rather than inline, and use a translation lookup function to display it. This way, to add Spanish support, they just add new YAML entries. It also prevents things like concatenating strings in code (which can be problematic in translation).\
**Extra setting examples:** A project might delay i18n if it's not in immediate scope, but here they specifically want it. If false, the AI might embed English text directly, making future translation harder. With it true, every feature developed will be ready for localization, which is a forward-thinking approach (especially since audience could be global, given nonprofits etc.). It might slightly slow development (as i18n requires a bit more work), but it pays off when you add new languages.

**ENSURE_PRIVACY_BEST_PRACTICES** | TRUE\\
**Interpretation:** The AI should adhere to **privacy best practices**. This includes handling personal data carefully (e.g., not logging sensitive info, using encryption for personal data at rest or in transit if applicable, anonymizing data if used in analytics, following data minimization principles, etc.). Essentially, any code that touches user data should consider privacy implications: only collect what's needed, secure it, and allow for deletion if needed.\
**Why Useful:** In an era of strict privacy laws (GDPR, etc.), building privacy into the product is crucial. For instance, if the AI implements an analytics feature, it will ensure not to collect identifiable info without need, or if the user profile includes sensitive data, it might ensure that's encrypted in the database. Privacy breaches can ruin trust and cause legal issues; this rule helps preempt such problems. Also, a privacy-conscious design often overlaps with security and maintainability in good ways (like clear data flows).\
**Extra setting examples:** It's somewhat rare to see this explicitly in code instructions, but it's excellent. If not stated, the AI might inadvertently do something like store a user's email in plain text where it wasn't necessary or keep debug logs of user inputs, etc. With this true, it'll be mindful -- maybe add notices if a piece of data looks like it could be sensitive. It shows the product likely deals with user data seriously (e.g., maybe grant applications data, which can be sensitive).

**ENSURE_CI_CD_BEST_PRACTICES** | TRUE\\
**Interpretation:** The AI needs to ensure its changes fit **CI/CD best practices**. In coding terms, this might mean writing code that won't break the build pipeline, adhering to formatting that passes linters, including necessary tests so CI passes, and perhaps structuring things so that deployment scripts (Dockerfiles, etc.) remain working. It could also imply following commit message conventions or branch strategies if it were committing (though likely out of scope). Essentially, any code or config produced should integrate smoothly with continuous integration and deployment.\
**Why Useful:** It keeps the automation pipeline green and efficient. If the AI, for example, adds a new dependency, CI best practice means updating dependency files properly (like requirements.txt or package.json) so builds don't fail. Or if it writes code, it should do so in a way that existing tests (or linters) won't fail -- i.e., not ignoring test failures, etc. This is important because an AI might be able to produce code that *works* but if it doesn't play nicely with CI (style issues, missing tests), the team can't merge it. By following CI/CD practices, the AI's contributions remain deployment-ready.\
**Extra setting examples:** Given they have GitHub Actions and Snyk, etc., the AI will be aware that any security issues or lint issues it introduces will cause CI to fail. So likely it will proactively run linters and tests (which we see in After Action Validation) and fix things. This setting is a general mandate to always consider those pipeline requirements while coding, not just after. It's again about thinking ahead to integration, not just local correctness.

**ENSURE_DEVEX_BEST_PRACTICES** | TRUE\\
**Interpretation:** The AI should follow best practices that improve **developer experience (DevEx)**. DevEx is a bit broad, but it usually means making things easier for developers to work on: clear code organization, helpful error messages, good documentation (overlaps with other things), consistent development environment setups, etc. For example, ensuring that if a developer pulls the code, it runs with one command, or if there's a configuration, it's well-documented or has sane defaults. The AI might, due to this rule, update readme or scripts when it changes something big, or ensure any config changes come with clear instructions.\
**Why Useful:** Happy developers mean faster progress and fewer mistakes. By focusing on developer experience, the project becomes easier to maintain and contribute to. This might translate into little things like maintaining clear directory structures, updating the `frontend_design_bible.md` or `ops_runbook.md` if code changes affect them (which ties into docs rules later), or writing code that is self-explanatory. It's somewhat abstract, but it signals that even internal quality-of-life features (like a script to reset the dev database, if needed) should be kept in mind by the AI.\
**Extra setting examples:** Not many configs mention DevEx explicitly, so this is forward-thinking. It overlaps with maintainability and docs and such, but implies a focus on the team's efficiency. Possibly, the AI might do things like improving error logs to be more descriptive because that helps devs debug -- a devex consideration. Setting it false would just mean devex improvements happen only if explicitly asked, but here it's a constant concern.

**WRITE_TESTS** | TRUE\\
**Interpretation:** The AI is required to **write tests** for its code changes. Whenever it implements a feature or fixes a bug, it should also produce appropriate automated tests (unit tests, integration tests, etc., as applicable) to validate that behavior. This applies to both backend (likely Python tests, maybe using something like PyTest or Django's test framework) and frontend (Vitest for React).\
**Why Useful:** Tests are the safety net ensuring that current and future changes don't break functionality. By mandating tests, they ensure code quality and help maintain long-term stability. It also helps document expected behavior. For example, if the AI adds a new API endpoint, it will accompany it with tests that confirm it returns the correct data and handles edge cases. This not only catches issues now but prevents regressions later -- since CI will run these tests on future changes.\
**Extra setting examples:** It's increasingly common to require tests for any new code, and here the AI is no exception. If false, the AI might skip tests to save time, but that's technical debt building up. With true, even though writing tests means more work in the short term, it pays off. The earlier config already ensures tests must pass, so writing tests ensures that new functionality is covered by those passes. The presence of `WRITE_TESTS: TRUE` also means the AI planning phase will likely allocate time to create test files, and the after-validation phase will run them.

[AFTER_ACTION_VALIDATION] -- Post-Change Testing and Quality Assurance
----------------------------------------------------------------------

*This section defines what the AI must do **immediately after coding** the changes, focusing on running tests, linters, security scans, and how to handle any failures. It's essentially an automated QA step to validate the changes before considering the action complete.*

**RUN_CODE_QUALITY_TOOLS** | TRUE\\
**Interpretation:** After writing the code, the AI will run **code quality tools** -- such as linters (Ruff for Python, ESLint for JS) and possibly formatters or static analyzers -- to check for style issues, syntax errors, or simple bugs. Essentially, the AI double-checks its work against these tools just like a developer would run `npm run lint` or similar.\
**Why Useful:** Even though the AI strives to write clean code, having the code quality tools confirm that ensures nothing was missed. Linters can catch subtle issues (unused variables, undefined variables, etc.) and enforce consistency. By running them immediately, the AI can fix any flagged issues before moving forward. This increases the chance that the code will pass CI when pushed. It's also a learning loop for the AI; if it sees lint errors, it can adjust its coding patterns next time.\
**Extra setting examples:** They certainly use Ruff and ESLint as per earlier info, so the AI will likely integrate those or simulate them. If this were false, they'd rely on CI to catch issues, which is slower and breaks the flow. True means the AI will give the user a result that's already cleaned up, which is nice. It could be that the AI has an internal tool invocation or just checks formatting by itself -- the specifics aren't given, but the intent is clear.

**RUN_SECURITY_AUDIT_TOOL** | TRUE\\
**Interpretation:** The AI will run a **security audit tool** (like Snyk, as mentioned in the CI config) after making changes. This tool will scan the project (and new code) for known vulnerabilities or insecure code patterns. For instance, it might check dependencies for known CVEs, or analyze code for things like using a weak crypto function.\
**Why Useful:** It provides an immediate security check on the new changes. If the AI accidentally introduced a vulnerability or a dependency with a vulnerability, this tool can flag it right away. By running it now, the AI can address the issue in the same action rather than leaving it for later detection. It's much like having a security unit test -- shift left on security.\
**Extra setting examples:** This is somewhat unusual for a local dev step (often security scans run in CI), but given the importance they place on security, it's here. Possibly the AI can run Snyk CLI or something similar. If false, a vulnerability might only be caught when CI runs, delaying fix. True ensures the AI takes responsibility for security as part of its done criteria. It aligns with their earlier rule to override false positives -- meaning they expect to handle those too if encountered.

**RUN_TESTS** | TRUE\\
**Interpretation:** The AI will run the automated **test suite** after making the code changes. This includes any new tests it wrote and all existing tests. Essentially, it verifies that nothing is broken (all tests still pass) and that the new functionality behaves as expected (the new tests pass).\
**Why Useful:** Running tests is the primary way to ensure the code's correctness. Even if the AI tried to be careful, only by running the tests can it confidently say the changes integrate well. This step catches regressions that might have been inadvertently introduced. For example, maybe a change in one module breaks a different feature's test -- the AI will catch that now and can address it before finalizing. It's a critical QA step to maintain the integrity of the codebase.\
**Extra setting examples:** If set false, they'd be relying on CI to run tests later or, worse, risk merging broken code. True indicates this project values a **test-driven mindset**: if it doesn't pass tests, it's not done. We saw earlier rules making sure tests are written and that failing tests trigger user decisions; this is the actual execution of those tests.

**REQUIRE_PASSING_TESTS** | TRUE\\
**Interpretation:** It is mandated that **all tests must pass** for the action to be considered successful. If any test (old or new) fails after the changes, that's treated as a problem that needs resolution. The AI cannot just ignore failing tests; it must treat that as a blocking issue.\
**Why Useful:** This sets a strict quality bar: no regressions allowed. It means the AI has to either fix the code or adjust expectations if a test fails (for instance, if the test was wrong or outdated, perhaps the AI would seek confirmation to update the test). It also communicates to the user that unless tests are green, the job isn't done. This reduces the chance of introducing bugs.\
**Extra setting examples:** In some emergency or experimental scenarios, one might allow proceeding with known failing tests (maybe marking them as expected failures, etc.), but here they are not allowing that unless the user explicitly chooses to proceed anyway (as indicated later). Requiring passing tests by default ensures stability. Combined with the user prompt on failure, it's a safety net.

**REQUIRE_PASSING_LINTERS** | TRUE\\
**Interpretation:** Similar to tests, this requires that **all linters (code quality checks) pass** with no errors (and probably no warnings, depending on threshold) after the changes. The AI must fix any lingering lint issues before considering its job done.\
**Why Useful:** It enforces code consistency and quality. If the linter flags something, even minor, it could be indicative of a problem or just a style violation -- either way, cleaning it up keeps the codebase clean and keeps CI happy. It also instills a discipline in the AI to write code that meets standards from the get-go. In effect, this means by the time the user sees the final code, it's already formatted and checked, so code review can focus on logic rather than style nits.\
**Extra setting examples:** Some teams treat linter warnings as non-blocking, but apparently here they want a zero-warning policy (likely). It's good for an AI to follow that because it can address things instantly. If false, sloppy or inconsistent code might slip through, which goes against the high standards they've set everywhere else. So it makes sense to enforce it.

**REQUIRE_NO_SECURITY_ISSUES** | TRUE\\
**Interpretation:** After running the security audit, there should be **no security issues found**. If the tool flags any vulnerabilities or risks, the AI must consider that a failure state that needs addressing. In other words, the AI should not conclude the action is finished while there are known security concerns in the result.\
**Why Useful:** This is a direct commitment to security. By requiring a clean security report, they ensure the AI either fixes issues or at least surfaces them for user decision (maybe some could be false positives or require big changes to fix). It prevents situations where an AI introduces a vulnerability and says "done" without acknowledging it. It also likely means the AI would try to remediate automatically if possible (like bump a library version if Snyk says it's vulnerable).\
**Extra setting examples:** In reality, some security issues are not trivial to fix on the spot; an alternative might be to allow merging with a warning if minor. But given this config, they want to catch and handle everything immediately. They even allow overriding Snyk false positives in CI, but that implies known false positives can be marked so they don't count. Essentially, any *legit* security issue must be resolved or explicitly accepted by user (see next lines with user answers). It's a strong security posture.

**IF_FAIL** | ASK_USER\\
**Interpretation:** "If any of the above validation steps fail" -- meaning if tests fail, or linters are not clean, or a security issue is found -- then the AI should **ask the user** how to proceed rather than making unilateral decisions. The AI will likely present the failure (like "X test failed" or "security scan found Y vulnerability") and then prompt the user for what to do next.\
**Why Useful:** This engages the user in critical decisions. There are multiple possible ways to handle a failure: fix it, roll back, ignore it, etc. Instead of the AI guessing the right course (which might be wrong), it defers to the user's judgment. This is important because some fixes might be non-trivial or out of scope, and the user might prefer to handle them separately or accept a risk temporarily. It prevents the AI from either going on an endless bug-fixing tangent or from finalizing with issues without sign-off.\
**Extra setting examples:** They wisely set up some standard user responses (next entry) to streamline this interaction. If this were "IF_FAIL: ABORT" automatically, it might just roll everything back without user input, possibly wasting work that the user might have been okay with. If it were "PROCEED_ANYWAY" automatically, that'd be risky. So asking the user is the most flexible and user-friendly approach.

**USER_ANSWERS_ACCEPTED** | ROLLBACK; RESOLVE_ISSUES; PROCEED_ANYWAY; ABORT AS IS\\
**Interpretation:** These are the **explicit options** the user can respond with when a post-validation failure is encountered, and the AI will understand and act accordingly:

-   **ROLLBACK:** Throw away the changes and return to the pre-change state (thanks to caching that state). Essentially undo everything the AI did during the action.

-   **RESOLVE_ISSUES:** Instruct the AI to attempt to fix the issues (tests, security, etc.) and continue. The AI would then focus on addressing the failing tests or vulnerabilities and re-run validation.

-   **PROCEED ANYWAY:** Tell the AI to ignore the failures and finalize the action regardless. This is an acknowledgment from the user that they accept the risk (maybe for a temporary state or to handle it themselves later).

-   **ABORT AS IS:** Stop the process now but **leave the changes in place** as they currently are, even if things are failing. This is a bit like "we'll take it from here" -- the AI stops working, but doesn't roll back what it did. Possibly the user wants to manually intervene from the partially completed state.\
    **Why Useful:** By defining these responses, the user knows exactly what their choices are and the AI can easily parse them. It covers the main actions a developer might want in such a situation: revert, fix, push through, or stop with code still there. It gives control to the user to determine how to handle an unsatisfactory outcome. This clarity avoids miscommunication; e.g. the user saying "hmm fix it maybe" could be ambiguous, but if they say "RESOLVE_ISSUES", it's clear.\
    **Extra setting examples:** The presence of "PROCEED_ANYWAY" and "ABORT AS IS" acknowledges that sometimes they might knowingly accept issues (maybe minor ones) or want to halt AI involvement. "ABORT AS IS" is an interesting one -- essentially freezing the work mid-state. Perhaps the team sometimes wants to inspect or hand-tweak the partially completed solution. Without these options, the AI might default to always trying to fix until everything is perfect, which could be inefficient if, say, one test fails due to an environment quirk that the user knows about. This design puts a human in the loop when needed.

**POST_TO_CHAT** | DELTAS_ONLY\\
**Interpretation:** When presenting results to the user at the end of validation (assuming things passed or the user chose to proceed), the AI should post **only the "deltas"** -- meaning the summary of changes rather than the full content. "Deltas" likely refers to a diff or a concise list of what changed, rather than printing entire file contents. For example, instead of showing the whole new file, it might say "Added function X to module Y; Modified Z lines in component W." Or it could present a unified diff snippet for each file.\
**Why Useful:** This keeps the output concise and focused. The user doesn't need to see all code (they can open the files in their IDE or rely on version control for that). Instead, they want to know *what* changed in summary: which files were touched and in what way. This is especially helpful if the changes are large -- dumping hundreds of lines in chat is not practical to review. A delta view allows quicker code review and understanding.\
**Extra setting examples:** If it were "FULL", the AI might spew entire file contents, which is overwhelming. "DELTAS_ONLY" suggests they likely want a manageable output even if changes are big. It may also automatically integrate with how the chat or environment shows diffs. This format is similar to how code review tools show changes. It likely pairs with after-action alignment's final summary posting, where they enumerate file changes, etc. So the AI's final message will say what it did rather than dumping all code verbatim.

[AFTER_ACTION_ALIGNMENT] -- Post-Change Documentation and Consistency
---------------------------------------------------------------------

*This section ensures that once code changes are done, all related project artifacts are updated: documentation, to-do lists, etc., and checks are made for consistency. It's about aligning the rest of the project with the new code.*

**UPDATE_DOCS** | TRUE\\
**Interpretation:** After making code changes, the AI will **update any relevant documentation** in the codebase to reflect those changes. This primarily refers to documentation that directly corresponds to the code (like README files, documentation in `/docs`, or comments in configuration files). For example, if a new API endpoint was added, the AI should update the API docs or usage examples. If a config setting changed, it should update any doc that describes configuration.\
**Why Useful:** Code and docs can drift apart; by automatically updating docs, they aim to keep them in sync. This helps future developers and users -- as soon as a feature is added or changed, the documentation will be current. It saves time (not relying on developers to remember to update docs later) and maintains the "single source of truth" principle. For instance, if the installation process changed due to the code update, the AI will adjust the install guide accordingly.\
**Extra setting examples:** This is quite advanced -- not all projects enforce doc updates for every change because it's effort, but since an AI can do it quickly, they leverage that. If it were false, docs might lag behind, which they flagged earlier as problematic. True means the AI treats documentation as a first-class part of the output of any action.

**UPDATE_AUXILIARY_DOCS** | TRUE\\
**Interpretation:** In addition to the main docs, the AI will update **auxiliary documentation**. These could be design docs, runbooks, maintenance guides, or any other supporting documents not directly user-facing but important for the team (like those listed under DEV_README files earlier). For example, if a security hardening measure was added in code, the AI should update `security_hardening.md`. Or if a new feature affects ops, update `ops_runbook.md`.\
**Why Useful:** It ensures that every piece of written knowledge about the project stays current, not just the primary user docs. Auxiliary docs often guide internal processes or future development, so keeping them updated means fewer "tribal knowledge" gaps. It also shows this system is intended to be comprehensive -- even architecture diagrams or design rationales might be updated by the AI when code changes.\
**Extra setting examples:** If false, those documents could become stale and misleading. True is ambitious but makes sense with an AI's assistance. It basically offloads the chore of maintenance documentation from humans to the AI. Developers will appreciate having accurate runbooks or design docs when they come back later.

**UPDATE_TODO** | TRUE *(CRITICAL)*\\
**Interpretation:** After finishing the tasks, the AI will update the **To-Do list or issue tracker** (in this case a `/ToDo.md`presumably) to mark tasks as done or add new tasks that emerged. Marked as "CRITICAL", this implies it's very important to keep the to-do list accurate. For example, if the user's request was to implement Feature X (which was an item on the to-do list), the AI should mark that item complete. If in doing the work it discovered something else needs doing later, it might add an item.\
**Why Useful:** Maintaining an up-to-date task list is crucial for project management. It provides at-a-glance info on progress. If tasks linger as "not done" when they are done, or vice versa, it causes confusion. By having the AI do it immediately, nothing is forgotten. The "CRITICAL" tag suggests maybe they integrate this with CI or reviews (like failing CI if to-do isn't updated on a relevant change). It shows they had pain with outdated tasks before and want strict enforcement now.\
**Extra setting examples:** The emphasis indicates a likely automated check. Possibly, any commit referencing a to-do item must update it, and the AI is ensuring that. If this were false, completed tasks might remain open and new tasks found by the AI might be lost unless a human notes them. True means the AI contributes to project planning hygiene actively.

**SCAN_DOCS_FOR_CONSISTENCY** | TRUE\\
**Interpretation:** The AI will scan through the documentation to ensure **consistency** after the changes. That means checking that none of the updated docs conflict with each other or with the new code state. For example, if one doc says "we use Library A" and the project switched to Library B, the AI will catch that and update references. Or if terminology changed (say, renaming a feature), it ensures all docs use the new name.\
**Why Useful:** Consistent documentation prevents confusion. If different docs describe things differently, it's hard to know what's correct. After changes, especially broad ones, inconsistency is likely (some docs updated, others not). The AI doing a pass to align them means developers and users get a single coherent narrative. It's basically a proofreading step on a project-wide scale, something very helpful that humans often neglect due to time.\
**Extra setting examples:** This goes along with "update docs" but extends to checking unedited parts for needed edits. If false, some docs might remain slightly out-of-sync. True ensures thoroughness. The AI might use techniques like cross-referencing keywords or feature names across docs to see if something stands out as old info.

**SCAN_DOCS_FOR_UP_TO_DATE** | TRUE\\
**Interpretation:** Similarly, the AI will check that documentation is **up-to-date** with the current state of the code and project. This is about detecting outdated content. For example, a guide that mentions a step that is no longer required or references an old version number or a removed feature should be flagged and updated or removed.\
**Why Useful:** Outdated docs can be harmful -- they might instruct someone to do something that's no longer applicable, wasting time or causing errors. By scanning for up-to-date-ness, the AI helps retire or refresh stale information. It likely will remove sections that are obsolete or at least call them out. This continuous upkeep saves the team from big doc overhauls later and helps onboarding (because new people reading docs won't be misled by old info).\
**Extra setting examples:** It pairs with consistency, but specifically targets content that might not have been automatically updated by earlier steps. True means the AI might even identify sections that haven't been touched in a long time and double-check if they're still valid. Perhaps it cross-checks code references in docs (like if a function mentioned in docs doesn't exist anymore, that doc is outdated). They clearly treat documentation like living code, which is great.

**PURGE_OBSOLETE_DOCS_CONTENT** | TRUE\\
**Interpretation:** The AI should **remove any content in the docs that is obsolete** after the changes. Obsolete content might be references to features that were removed, instructions that are no longer needed, or old data formats that aren't used. Essentially, if something in the docs is now irrelevant or misleading due to changes, it gets purged (deleted or archived).\
**Why Useful:** Trimming out dead info keeps docs lean and relevant. It's frustrating for developers to read through docs with sections that no longer apply, not knowing if they should ignore them. By purging, the AI ensures everything in the documentation is meant to be there and reflects reality. This also reduces maintenance load -- fewer pages to keep updating if they're not needed.\
**Extra setting examples:** They have a thorough approach: not just update and add, but remove what's no longer needed. If this were false, they might leave outdated sections with maybe a note, but that can clutter things. True means a more aggressive cleanup, which suggests they trust the AI to know what's safe to remove or they are comfortable with version control to retrieve info if needed.

**PURGE_DEPRECATED_DOCS_CONTENT** | TRUE\\
**Interpretation:** Similarly, the AI will remove or update any **deprecated content** in documentation. This refers to sections that might have been marked as deprecated (like "this approach is old, we'll remove it in future") -- now perhaps the time has come to eliminate them, or at least clearly label them. If the code removed a deprecated feature, the docs about it should be removed too.\
**Why Useful:** Deprecated content can confuse readers, especially if it lingers after the code has moved on. Clearing it ensures nobody accidentally follows deprecated guidance. It also signals that if the team decided something is deprecated, they actually follow through in cleaning up references, which is good project hygiene.\
**Extra setting examples:** If some docs were flagged "(Deprecated)" and the AI now sees that feature gone, it will purge that section. This goes hand-in-hand with purging obsolete content; the distinction is subtle but deprecated implies it was intentionally phased out. True indicates they want no half-measures; once something is gone or on its way out, the docs shouldn't keep endorsing it.

**IF_DOCS_OUTDATED** | ASK_USER\\
**Interpretation:** If, during alignment, the AI finds that **documentation is outdated** in ways that aren't trivial to fix automatically, it will ask the user what to do. This could happen if the AI isn't confident how to update a section, or if updating would require decisions (for instance, a major part of docs hasn't been updated in ages -- do they rewrite it now or confirm if feature still exists?). Essentially, the AI pauses and says "I suspect these docs are outdated relative to the code -- how should we handle them?"\
**Why Useful:** It introduces a human check when documentation gaps are significant. While the AI is powerful, some documentation might require nuance or could be intentionally left outdated if a rewrite is planned. Asking the user ensures the AI doesn't do something presumptuous like deleting a whole guide because it thinks it's outdated, without confirmation. It's a safety valve to keep documentation aligned with user expectations.\
**Extra setting examples:** This is akin to the IF_ checks earlier. It shows respect for documentation -- sometimes maybe the AI can't find an obvious new info to update an outdated section, so better to get guidance. If false (i.e., if they had an automated approach), the AI might try to update everything on its own, which could be risky. They prefer a collaboration on docs when uncertainty arises.

**IF_DOCS_INCONSISTENT** | ASK_USER\\
**Interpretation:** If the AI detects **inconsistencies among docs** (like conflicting information that it isn't sure how to reconcile), it will ask the user for clarification or direction. For example, if one doc says "Feature X behaves like A" and another says "Feature X behaves like B" after changes, and the AI doesn't know which is correct, it will flag this to the user.\
**Why Useful:** While the AI will try to make docs consistent, there might be cases where it's not clear what the single source of truth should be. Bringing the user in avoids the AI picking the wrong one. The user can then tell it which is correct, or provide the proper info to unify them. This results in correct documentation rather than just internally consistent but possibly wrong documentation.\
**Extra setting examples:** This is similar to IF_DOCS_OUTDATED in principle -- the AI doesn't steamroll docs if it's not sure. If not present, the AI might guess and possibly propagate an error across docs. So asking is prudent. It implies the AI likely has a method to flag such inconsistencies (maybe by comparing key statements or values in different docs).

**IF_TODO_OUTDATED** | RESOLVE_IMMEDIATELY\\
**Interpretation:** If the AI finds the **to-do list is outdated** -- perhaps containing tasks that are no longer relevant or missing tasks that should be there -- it is instructed to **resolve it immediately** by itself. "Resolve immediately" suggests the AI will either update or remove those outdated items on the spot, without needing to ask the user. It treats an outdated to-do entry as something to fix right away.\
**Why Useful:** An outdated to-do list can mislead the team about what's left to do. Marking something done when it isn't (or vice versa) is critical. They marked updating the to-do as critical, and this further ensures any discrepancy is handled. For example, if during alignment the AI notices an item still open that was actually completed in this action or earlier, it will mark it done now. Or if an item doesn't make sense anymore because the plan changed, it will adjust or remove it.\
**Extra setting examples:** They don't even ask the user here, showing how important they think an accurate to-do list is. Possibly because if the code and docs are updated, then any to-do items related should definitely be updated too -- no ambiguity. It's interesting they specifically say "resolve immediately" instead of just true/false, emphasizing urgency. This might mean the AI should not finish the action until the to-do list is fully synced up.

[AFTER_ACTION_CLEANUP] -- Final Cleanup of Temporary and Sensitive Artifacts
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

*This section covers the very last steps after everything else: cleaning up any temporary files, cached data, or sensitive information that may have been used during the action. It's about leaving the project and environment clean and secure.*

**PURGE_TEMP_FILES** | TRUE\\
**Interpretation:** The AI should delete any **temporary files** it created or used during the operation. These could be things like scratch files, build artifacts, or any intermediate files (for example, if it generated a patch file or downloaded a resource temporarily). By the end of the action, none of those should remain cluttering the workspace.\
**Why Useful:** Temporary files can cause confusion, take up space, or even pose security risks if they contain bits of info. Cleaning them ensures the repository or environment stays tidy. For instance, if the AI ran tests or built assets, it might remove coverage reports or build output that isn't needed in the repo (if not .gitignored). It's akin to cleaning up after yourself so that the next run or developer doesn't have to deal with leftover garbage.\
**Extra setting examples:** Without this, such files might linger. Many dev environments rely on .gitignore and manual cleanup, but an AI could accidentally commit or leave something. This rule forces it to proactively clean. Possibly "PURGE_TEMP_FILES" also covers ensuring nothing unintended is staged for commit except real changes. All in all, a housekeeping step.

**PURGE_SENSITIVE_DATA** | TRUE\\
**Interpretation:** The AI will remove any **sensitive data** that might have been exposed or used. This could include credentials, API keys, personal data that might have been in logs or variables, etc. If during the action the AI had to handle secrets (maybe an API token to run a tool) or it generated logs containing private info, it should erase those from memory, config, or files.\
**Why Useful:** It's a security measure to ensure no secrets leak into the codebase or logs. If the AI fetched some environment variables to run tests (like a dummy API key), it should ensure those don't get printed or stored. Also, if any debug output contains user data or internal info, wiping that keeps things safe. This helps maintain the principle of least exposure -- once something sensitive has served its purpose, it shouldn't persist in any accessible form.\
**Extra setting examples:** This suggests the system is quite security-conscious. Not many dev workflows include an explicit "scrub sensitive data" step, but an AI might inadvertently log something. They're making sure the AI double-checks. If false, there's a risk of secrets creeping into commit history or artifacts. True implies maybe the AI scans its outputs to ensure nothing like a password or key is left visible.

**PURGE_CACHED_DATA** | TRUE\\
**Interpretation:** The AI should clear any **cached data** it created during the process. Cached data might mean things like in-memory caches, temporary database records, or local caches of responses (maybe if it did some web queries or used a language server or search index). Essentially, anything cached for performance or lookup during the action should be invalidated or deleted after.\
**Why Useful:** Caches are context-specific. Keeping them around could cause stale data issues in subsequent runs or occupy unnecessary space. By purging caches, each action starts fresh or at least with known good data. For example, if the AI cached file lists or search results, it should refresh next time to avoid using outdated info. This ensures integrity of each independent action.\
**Extra setting examples:** It might also be about privacy -- cached data could include things like snippets of user's input or code that aren't needed anymore. Clearing that ensures no accidental reuse or leak. Most likely, if the AI has any scratchpad or memory of intermediate results, it's wiped clean to avoid cross-contamination between tasks. This is a bit abstract but points to thorough cleanup.

**PURGE_API_KEYS** | TRUE\\
**Interpretation:** The AI should remove any **API keys** or credentials that were used during the action from any place they don't belong. For instance, if the AI had to insert an API key into a config to run something and it was just for testing, it should remove it. Or if it fetched secrets to use, ensure they're not left visible.\
**Why Useful:** This is a specific case of sensitive data, emphasized because API keys in particular should not end up in code or logs accidentally. If an AI is integrated with external services (like Snyk or Stripe), it might have keys configured in environment; this rule likely ensures none of those keys appear in the final code or documentation. Possibly the AI might temporarily include a dummy key in a config to get a test to run, but then should strip it out.\
**Extra setting examples:** Given they list it separately, they really want to double-down on not leaking credentials. That's wise -- an AI could inadvertently output a key if not careful. True means there's an active check or step to sanitize any such occurrences. Essentially, by the end of the action, the codebase should have no secret tokens inadvertently added.

**PURGE_OBSOLETE_CODE** | TRUE\\
**Interpretation:** The AI should remove any **obsolete code** that's left in the project as a result of the changes. If the new changes made some code paths or modules unused (obsolete), it should delete them. For example, if it refactored two functions into one, the old ones should be removed. Or if a feature was replaced entirely, the remnants of the old implementation should be purged.\
**Why Useful:** Lingering obsolete code can confuse developers and potentially introduce bugs if someone accidentally uses it. By cleaning it up immediately, the codebase stays lean and clear. It's similar to purging obsolete docs, but for code. This rule likely kicks in if during execution the AI realized "hey, after this change, function A isn't called anymore" -- it will then remove function A. This keeps technical debt low.\
**Extra setting examples:** This could be tricky because sometimes you might keep code around for backward compatibility (but that wouldn't be "obsolete", that would be deprecated). Obsolete implies truly not needed. The AI's earlier phase likely identified such code via checks (IF_OBSOLETE_CODE -> propose refactor). Now after action, if some new obsolescence was created, it will handle it. If false, dead code might accumulate and require periodic cleanups. True means the AI does constant gardening of the codebase.

**PURGE_DEPRECATED_CODE** | TRUE\\
**Interpretation:** Similarly, remove any code that has been **deprecated** and is now safe to delete. Deprecated code might have been kept around for a while (with warnings not to use it), but perhaps this action or context means it's time to remove it entirely. The AI will scrub out deprecated functions, endpoints, config flags, etc., that are no longer needed.\
**Why Useful:** Continuing to carry deprecated code indefinitely is burdensome and risky (someone might accidentally still use it, or it might rot untested). By purging it when appropriate, they keep the codebase up-to-date. For example, if they deprecated an old API version and now the new version is stable, the AI might remove the old one. This ensures that everything in the code is current and intentional.\
**Extra setting examples:** This likely happens in coordination with the product lifecycle. If a code was marked deprecated in a previous sprint and no references remain, the AI can remove it. True suggests an aggressive cleanup policy, which is consistent with the other rules. It might be moderated by requiring user approval (maybe the deprecation process was to mark then remove in a later action with confirmation). The AI could also decide to only purge if tests show nothing fails without it.

**PURGE_UNUSED_CODE** | UNLESS_SCOPED_PLACEHOLDER_FOR_LATER_USE\\
**Interpretation:** The AI will remove any **unused code**, except in cases where the code is clearly a placeholder for future use and is marked as such. Unused code refers to functions, classes, variables that are defined but not utilized anywhere. The caveat "unless scoped placeholder for later use" suggests if the code is intentionally left unused as a stub or template (maybe annotated in comments that it's for later or wrapped in a feature flag), the AI should not remove it.\
**Why Useful:** Removing truly unused code cleans up clutter and prevents confusion. If nobody is calling a function, it's just noise. However, the rule smartly avoids removing code that might be part of an ongoing plan (for example, they created a module skeleton for a feature that isn't fully wired yet). So it balances cleanup with not disrupting intended scaffolding. The AI likely can detect placeholders via comments or naming (e.g., a function named `futureFeatureStub` or a `TODO:` comment might signal intentional unused code).\
**Extra setting examples:** Without that exception, the AI might remove code that the team planned to use shortly, causing rework. They clearly foresee that scenario and allow placeholders to remain. It indicates a structured approach: maybe the project generates code stubs intentionally (maybe via `/document` or /planning phases). The AI must use judgment here. It's a nuanced instruction showing they considered development workflow.

**POST_TO_CHAT** | ACTION_SUMMARY; FILE_CHANGES; RISKS_MITIGATED; VALIDATION_RESULTS; DOCS_UPDATED; EXPECTED_BEHAVIOR\\
**Interpretation:** At the very end of the entire action (after alignment and cleanup), the AI should post a comprehensive summary to the chat including:

-   **Action Summary:** A high-level recap of what was done (e.g., "Implemented feature X and fixed bug Y").

-   **File Changes:** A list or overview of which files were created, modified, or deleted. Possibly number of lines or just names with brief context.

-   **Risks Mitigated:** Explanation of any potential risks that were addressed or mitigated during this process (for example, "Removed vulnerable dependency" or "Added input validation to mitigate security risks"). Essentially highlights how the AI handled any risk factors.

-   **Validation Results:** The outcomes of tests, lint, audit, etc. (e.g., "All 56 tests passed; no lint errors; security scan clean"). This reassures the user that the quality gates were cleared.

-   **Docs Updated:** A note on documentation changes, e.g., "Updated README and API docs to reflect the new endpoint; removed obsolete section on Z." This tells the user that docs are in sync.

-   **Expected Behavior:** A description of how the system should now behave from an end-user or system perspective after these changes. For instance, "Users can now upload profile pictures, which are stored securely. The login bug is fixed, so password resets work as expected." This confirms the functional outcome in plain terms.\
    **Why Useful:** This final report is golden for the user. It encapsulates everything in an easily digestible format. The user can see *what was changed* and *why*, verify that all checks passed, know that docs are handled, and understand the end result -- all without combing through code. It's like release notes combined with a mini code review report. This saves the user time and builds confidence in the changes. If something looks off in summary (like an unexpected file change), the user can catch it immediately.\
    **Extra setting examples:** They basically enumerated all the info a developer or project manager would want to know after a set of changes. Some systems might do less (maybe just file changes and tests). Here they want even the risks mitigated explicitly called out, which is great for security tracking. This thoroughness reflects the high-reliability goal. The AI likely formats this nicely (perhaps bullet points or sections). It effectively closes the loop, connecting back to the planning (which listed intended changes and risks) and confirming they were done and addressed.

[AUDIT] -- Full Project Audit Command Configuration
---------------------------------------------------

*This section defines how the AI should behave when the user invokes the **audit command**. The audit mode is for reviewing the entire codebase for various issues (security, performance, etc.) and providing a report.*

**BOUND_COMMAND** | AUDIT_COMMAND (`/audit`)\\
**Interpretation:** The audit functionality is tied to the specific user command `/audit`. When the user types `/audit`, the AI knows to switch from normal assist mode to performing a comprehensive project audit as configured here. Essentially, `/audit` triggers a read-only analysis mode rather than coding mode.\
**Why Useful:** Separating this under a command ensures that a full audit (which might be resource-intensive and produce a long report) is done only on explicit request. It prevents the AI from launching into an audit during a normal chat or code action unexpectedly. It also means the user has a straightforward way to ask for a deep review of the project's health.\
**Extra setting examples:** They could have multiple audit commands (like `/audit security` for a subset), but here it seems one command covers all aspects. The specific name is arbitrary but intuitive. If not bound as a command, a request for an audit might be interpreted variably -- this binding makes it deterministic.

**SCOPE** | FULL\\
**Interpretation:** When an audit is run, it will cover the **full codebase/project** rather than a subset. This means every module, configuration, and documentation could be considered in scope for analysis. It's not just a diff or recent changes; it's comprehensive.\
**Why Useful:** A full-scope audit ensures that nothing is missed. Partial audits might overlook issues in untouched parts of the code. If the goal is a thorough quality and consistency check, you want to scan everything. This might include parts of the system not recently worked on, which is good for catching legacy issues.\
**Extra setting examples:** If they wanted, they could have allowed a narrower audit (e.g., current module only), but "FULL" indicates that by default the audit is whole-project. Possibly the user can specify scope manually in the command (some systems do `/audit moduleX`), but by config, full is the standard. This aligns with doing a periodic complete health check.

**FREQUENCY** | UPON_COMMAND\\
**Interpretation:** The audit will run **only when the user explicitly commands it**. It's not automatically triggered on a schedule or after every action. "Upon command" means the AI isn't continuously auditing in the background; it waits for the user's `/audit` instruction.\
**Why Useful:** Auditing can be an expensive or lengthy process. You wouldn't want it running all the time or arbitrarily. By making it on-demand, the user can choose appropriate times (maybe before a release or when curious). It also keeps the normal workflow separate -- the AI won't surprise the user with audit info unless asked.\
**Extra setting examples:** They could have a periodic audit (like weekly) but that's likely handled by other systems (CI or human scheduling). Keeping it manual via command gives the user control. It's straightforward and avoids unnecessary overhead.

**AUDIT_FOR** | SECURITY; PERFORMANCE; MAINTAINABILITY; ACCESSIBILITY; I18N; PRIVACY; CI_CD; DEVEX; DEPRECATED_CODE; OUTDATED_DOCS; CONFLICTS; REDUNDANCIES; BEST_PRACTICES; CONFUSING_IMPLEMENTATIONS\\
**Interpretation:** This lists all the categories of issues the audit should cover:

-   **Security:** vulnerabilities, insecure patterns, missing encryption, etc.

-   **Performance:** inefficient algorithms, slow database queries, memory issues, etc.

-   **Maintainability:** messy code structure, lack of modularity, no comments where needed, etc.

-   **Accessibility:** issues in UI that affect users with disabilities (like missing alt text or keyboard traps).

-   **I18N (Internationalization):** hard-coded strings, not using the i18n system, assumptions of one locale.

-   **Privacy:** potential privacy violations, over-collection of data, personal info not handled correctly.

-   **CI/CD:** issues in the continuous integration or deployment setup (failing tests, no tests for critical parts, pipeline misconfigs). Could also include things like long build times or no monitoring of certain things.

-   **DevEx (Developer Experience):** things that make life harder for devs -- e.g., lack of documentation, unclear error messages, complicated setup.

-   **Deprecated Code:** any usage of functions or libs marked deprecated that should be removed.

-   **Outdated Docs:** documentation that is not up-to-date with current code or features.

-   **Conflicts:** possibly logical conflicts or contradictory implementations (or places where code duplicates work differently).

-   **Redundancies:** duplicate code, multiple libraries doing the same job, unnecessarily repeated logic.

-   **Best Practices:** any deviations from general best practices not covered by the above (could include coding style issues, lack of design patterns, etc.).

-   **Confusing Implementations:** code that works but is overly complex or non-intuitive, which should be refactored for clarity.\
    **Why Useful:** By enumerating these, the audit will be very thorough and structured. It ensures the AI doesn't just do, say, a security audit, but looks at the project's health holistically. This aligns with earlier goals of a high-quality, maintainable product. The user gets a broad spectrum analysis in one go instead of having to ask separately.\
    **Extra setting examples:** This is an extensive list. They basically threw everything at it, which is great for completeness. It reads like a checklist a lead engineer or QA might use when doing a full review. The AI can systematically go through each category and find issues. Projects might tailor this list (maybe exclude some if irrelevant), but here they want it all. It's possible the user can later say "just audit for security" if needed, but config-wise they want the full package.

**REPORT_FORMAT** | MARKDOWN\\
**Interpretation:** The audit report should be formatted in **Markdown**. This implies headings, bullet points, code blocks, etc., should be used to make the report clear and readable, likely directly in the chat or in a file.\
**Why Useful:** Markdown ensures the report is nicely structured and easy to read in the chat interface or if saved to a .md file. For example, issues might be listed as bullets or tables; sections for each category can be headings. It's a good choice because it's human-friendly but also can be converted to HTML or PDF if needed. It likely means the AI will produce the audit with proper Markdown syntax (like `## Security Issues` then bullet points of found issues, etc.).\
**Extra setting examples:** They could have chosen plain text or a JSON (if they wanted machine-readable output, but human readability is the goal here). Markdown is standard for documents and fits nicely since they probably will have multi-level lists or links. Sticking to one format also allows consistency over multiple audits.

**REPORT_CONTENT** | ISSUES_FOUND; RECOMMENDATIONS; RESOURCES\\
**Interpretation:** Each section of the audit report should contain:

-   **Issues Found:** a description of each problem or concern identified in that category.

-   **Recommendations:** actionable suggestions on how to fix or improve the issue. For instance, "Issue: Function X is too slow. Recommendation: Use indexing on the database query to improve speed."

-   **Resources:** references or links to documentation, best practice articles, or internal docs that provide more information or guidance related to the issue. E.g., linking to OWASP page for a security issue, or a style guide for code formatting.\
    **Why Useful:** This structure makes the audit report not just a list of complaints but a helpful guide. It tells the user what's wrong, how to fix it, and where to learn more or see standards. This is very educational and useful for the team -- they don't just know what to do, but also get context. For example, a security issue recommendation might link to a known library or official fix guidelines.\
    **Extra setting examples:** They basically want the AI to act like a consultant: find problems, propose solutions, back them up with references. Not all audits go this far (some just list issues), but this adds a lot of value. It aligns with an earlier insight that the AI should produce recommendations and resources -- they explicitly mandate it here. Potentially, resources might include things like relevant sections from their own docs if any, or external resources. The AI will likely include footnotes or markdown links. Very thorough!

**POST_TO_CHAT** | TRUE\\
**Interpretation:** When the audit is done, the AI should post the report directly to the chat for the user to read. This indicates the output is not just saved somewhere silently; it will be delivered in the conversation as a message (most likely formatted in Markdown as specified).\
**Why Useful:** It makes the results immediately visible to the user without requiring them to open a file or look elsewhere. Given this is an interactive setting, it makes sense -- the user invoked `/audit` in chat, so they expect a chat response. It's also useful because the user can then discuss issues right there with the AI or others.\
**Extra setting examples:** If false, maybe the AI would only save the report to a file or require the user to request it. True is default for an interactive assistant -- just give the answer (the audit findings) back in the conversation. It's straightforward.

[REFACTOR] -- Refactoring Command Configuration
-----------------------------------------------

*This section outlines how the AI should handle the refactor command, which is used to improve code structure or quality without changing functionality. It's similar to the action command, but specifically for refactoring tasks.*

**BOUND_COMMAND** | REFACTOR_COMMAND (`/refactor`)\\
**Interpretation:** The refactoring capabilities are bound to the `/refactor` user command. When the user types `/refactor`, the AI enters a mode aimed at improving the code (as opposed to adding new features or answering questions). It will then follow the guidelines in this section for how to plan and execute refactoring.\
**Why Useful:** It provides a clear way for the user to request purely non-functional improvements. By separating it from `/agent` (action), the AI can optimize its behavior: e.g., it knows that no new feature is being added, so tests shouldn't change in expected behavior, only code quality should improve. It also signals to the AI to focus on certain types of changes (like simplifying code, removing duplication) per the rules below. This separation of concerns keeps feature development and code cleanup in distinct workflows, which helps in managing complexity and reviewing changes.\
**Extra setting examples:** Alternate naming could be possible (`/clean` or `/refactor_code`), but they went with something straightforward. It also likely ties into how the system might present differences to the user (maybe labeling the output or commit as a refactor). If the user didn't have this, they might try to ask the AI in plain language "refactor X," but binding a command ensures a structured process is followed.

**SCOPE** | FULL\\
**Interpretation:** The refactor command, when invoked, can consider the **entire codebase** for improvements, not just a single file or module (unless the user specifically limits it in their request). "FULL" means the AI is allowed to make changes across the project in pursuit of better code quality.\
**Why Useful:** Sometimes effective refactoring involves multiple parts of the code (e.g., extracting a utility function that can replace duplicate code in several files). By having full scope, the AI can perform wide-reaching cleanups, such as consistent renaming across the codebase or removing global dead code. It ensures the refactor isn't narrow and can truly improve consistency project-wide.\
**Extra setting examples:** If this were limited (like "CURRENT_MODULE"), the AI might ignore issues elsewhere, but they want a holistic cleanup. However, the user could still request a narrow refactor if desired in their command; this just means by default it's not restricted. Full scope refactoring is powerful; it's basically permission to overhaul architecture or code patterns anywhere as needed (with user approval steps).

**FREQUENCY** | UPON_COMMAND\\
**Interpretation:** Refactoring will be done **only when the user asks for it** via the command. It's not something the AI does automatically in the background or after every feature. The AI won't spontaneously go into refactor mode unless told (though it might propose refactoring in other modes, but it would then likely require switching to this command).\
**Why Useful:** Refactoring can be disruptive if done at the wrong time, and sometimes you don't want it (like right before a deadline). By making it user-triggered, it respects the user's control over when to invest in code cleanup. It also ensures the AI doesn't mix refactoring changes with feature changes unless explicitly combined by the user (keeping commits/purposes separate).\
**Extra setting examples:** This mirrors the audit frequency. They treat these special maintenance tasks as on-demand, which is sensible. Some extreme systems might auto-refactor periodically, but that's probably not desired here because it could conflict with in-progress work. They likely intend for the user to call /refactor whenever the codebase quality needs a boost or before releases, etc.

**PLAN_BEFORE_REFACTOR** | TRUE\\
**Interpretation:** Before performing the refactoring changes, the AI will create a **refactoring plan** and present it to the user. It won't jump straight into modifying code without first outlining what it intends to do.\
**Why Useful:** Refactoring can touch a lot of code, so it's important for the user to see the extent of changes and the approach beforehand. The plan might list which areas will be refactored, what patterns will change, and any potential risks. This gives the user a chance to give input or constraints (e.g., "don't refactor module X right now") and ensures alignment. It's similar to how the action command works with planning/approval.\
**Extra setting examples:** They basically treat refactoring with the same seriousness as a feature implementation -- planning and approval required. If false, the AI would just start refactoring, which might scare a user ("what are you doing to my code?!"). True fosters trust and collaboration, as the user remains in the loop. It might also allow them to say "that refactor sounds good, but don't rename this particular function because external scripts use it," etc.

**AWAIT_APPROVAL** | TRUE\\
**Interpretation:** After proposing the refactoring plan, the AI must **wait for the user's approval** before executing it. It won't proceed to code changes until the user explicitly OKs the plan.\
**Why Useful:** This is a safeguard. Refactors can sometimes inadvertently change behavior or conflict with ongoing work. By seeking approval, the user can vet the plan, perhaps run it by the team, or schedule it at a convenient time. It also ensures the user is ready for the codebase to go through potentially widespread changes (like all variables renamed from snake_case to camelCase, etc.).\
**Extra setting examples:** Similar to the action flow, if they trust the AI completely one might skip this, but it's wise to include it. They do allow override next, meaning if a user is in a hurry they can waive the approval step. But default is to ask, which is prudent for significant codebase alterations.

**OVERRIDE_APPROVAL_WITH_USER_REQUEST** | TRUE\\
**Interpretation:** If the user's refactor command or context implies "just do it without asking again," the AI can skip the approval step. Essentially, if the user already clearly stated what to refactor and gave go-ahead (maybe "/refactor everything to use new logger -- please proceed directly"), then the AI doesn't need an extra confirmation.\
**Why Useful:** This makes the system more efficient for power users. If someone explicitly says "yes, I want this refactor done now," it would be redundant for the AI to show a plan and ask "should I do it?". It respects the user's intent to streamline. Of course, the AI will likely still output what it plans to do or at least summarize changes as it goes, but it won't pause for confirmation.\
**Extra setting examples:** It's the same pattern as the action mode -- allow user to force immediate execution if desired. This flexibility is good because sometimes the plan is obvious or the user trusts the AI, and slowing down might not be necessary. It's all about user control; they can engage safety nets or bypass them.

**MINIMIZE_CHANGES** | TRUE\\
**Interpretation:** When refactoring, the AI should aim to make the **minimal changes necessary** to achieve the refactoring goals. It shouldn't refactor things that don't need refactoring or broaden the scope unnecessarily. Essentially, don't change what doesn't have to change.\
**Why Useful:** Every change has a risk of introducing bugs, even if not changing functionality. By minimizing changes, they limit that risk and also make the refactor easier to review. It also ensures that the refactor stays focused on the intended improvements rather than becoming an overzealous overhaul. For example, if the goal was to remove redundancy in two functions, it shouldn't also start renaming unrelated variables or reformatting code outside the scope. Less change = easier verification that no behavior changed.\
**Extra setting examples:** This is a bit like saying "don't do extra credit." Some might allow more broad clean-ups during a refactor, but they explicitly want to keep it tight. It's wise because if you mix too many refactor types, you might inadvertently alter something. The AI will probably interpret this as grouping related refactors or doing them incrementally rather than a huge wave. It compliments other constraints like ensure no functional changes and tests passing.

**MAXIMUM_PHASES** | 3\\
**Interpretation:** Just like with actions, a refactor can be broken into at most **3 phases** if it's complex. So if the refactor involves a lot of steps, the AI should not plan more than 3 sequential sub-refactors in one go. If more are needed, probably multiple refactor commands or sessions would be used.\
**Why Useful:** It keeps each refactoring session bounded and comprehensible. You wouldn't want a refactor that drags on through endless micro-phases -- that'd be hard to track and review. With a limit, the AI might combine related changes into up to three batches, maybe addressing different categories of refactoring (e.g., phase 1: code deduplication, phase 2: rename variables for consistency, phase 3: remove deprecated functions). It ensures the user isn't overwhelmed and that each phase can be tested thoroughly.\
**Extra setting examples:** They reuse the number 3 often, which suggests a pattern: small enough to manage. Could have been 2 or 5, but 3 is a reasonable compromise. If a refactor really needs more, they can always do another round later. This is consistent with their incremental approach to changes.

**PREEMPT_FOR** | SECURITY_ISSUES; FAILING_BUILDS_TESTS_LINTERS; BLOCKING_INCONSISTENCIES\\
**Interpretation:** Even during a refactor, if any of these critical issues are encountered, the AI should **preempt** the refactoring plan to address them first (or at least highlight them). This is basically the same list as for actions: if security issues exist or the build/tests are failing or there are big inconsistencies, those take precedence over purely refactoring.\
**Why Useful:** It ensures that the AI doesn't ignore urgent problems in favor of cosmetic improvements. For instance, if tests were failing before refactor (meaning code is broken), maybe fix that or notify instead of refactoring code that might not even be correct. Or if there's a known security hole, that's more important to fix than making the code prettier. It aligns with the idea that refactoring ideally happens on a green (passing) codebase. If not green, either fix it or postpone refactor.\
**Extra setting examples:** This is a direct parallel to the action planning phase, indicating consistency in how the AI prioritizes work. They don't want the AI polishing the paint while the house is on fire, so to speak. If any preempt condition is met, likely the AI will propose dealing with that either as part of the refactor plan or maybe aborting refactor to do a fix action instead. It's an interesting interplay: a refactor command might turn into a partial bugfix if needed, with user approval.

**PREEMPTION_REASON_REQUIRED** | TRUE\\
**Interpretation:** If the AI does have to preempt the refactor (like pause the planned improvements to fix a test), it must provide a **reason** to the user. It should explicitly say why it's deviating from the original refactor plan.\
**Why Useful:** Transparency again. The user might initiate a refactor thinking everything's fine, but if the AI says "I noticed tests are failing, so before refactoring I will fix that," the user needs to know why the plan changed. It fosters trust and helps the user agree that the detour is necessary.\
**Extra setting examples:** Same logic as before: always tell the user *why* when you change course. This being true in both action and refactor contexts means the AI will always communicate anomalies or higher priorities, which is great for collaboration.

**REFACTOR_FOR** | MAINTAINABILITY; PERFORMANCE; ACCESSIBILITY; I18N; SECURITY; PRIVACY; CI_CD; DEVEX; BEST_PRACTICES\\
**Interpretation:** This lists the focus areas or goals for refactoring. Essentially, when refactoring, the AI is looking to improve:

-   **Maintainability:** Simplify code structure, improve readability, reduce complexity.

-   **Performance:** Optimize any inefficient code if it can be done without altering features.

-   **Accessibility:** Improve the structure of UI code to be more accessible (though refactor shouldn't add new features, maybe it can add missing alt attributes as part of cleanup since it doesn't change core logic, etc.).

-   **I18N:** Ensure code is properly internationalized (e.g., move any missed hard-coded strings to locales, etc.).

-   **Security:** Remove insecure patterns (without changing functionality, e.g., refactor to use safer methods or better error handling).

-   **Privacy:** Ensure data handling is minimized and proper (like scrubbing PII in logs, etc., as part of refactor).

-   **CI_CD:** Refine scripts or config for builds/deploys if they are clunky (maybe restructure workflow files, etc., not user-facing).

-   **DevEx:** Clean up development scripts, improve error messages, refactor documentation for devs, basically anything that makes dev life easier.

-   **Best Practices:** General code conventions and patterns (maybe introduce design patterns where appropriate, or adhere to framework conventions).\
    **Why Useful:** It clearly defines what "refactoring" entails here. It's not just random changes -- it's targeted at improving these qualities without adding features. This helps the AI decide what to do. If code is maintainable but has a performance issue, it can tackle performance. If performance is fine but code is messy, focus maintainability. It's a comprehensive list, ensuring the AI can consider many angles of improvement.\
    **Extra setting examples:** This reads like a mirror of the audit categories, minus a couple like outdated_docs (docs are handled in alignment, not part of refactor presumably) and conflicts (which are more planning issues). So refactor specifically addresses code and process quality. They essentially want the codebase to be brought up to top standards in all these areas when refactoring. It's ambitious but fitting for a thorough AI assistant.

**ENSURE_NO_FUNCTIONAL_CHANGES** | TRUE\\
**Interpretation:** During refactoring, the AI must ensure it **does not change the external behavior** of the code. No new features, no logic changes that would alter outputs or side-effects. The goal is purely internal improvement. If any functional change is required (say to fix a bug or something), that's outside the scope of this refactor (unless it's from the preemption stuff, but that would be considered separately).\
**Why Useful:** This is the golden rule of refactoring: functionality remains identical, so that you only need to test that everything still passes as before. It allows safe improvements with the knowledge that if tests pass, nothing broke. It also keeps refactoring separate from feature development, making it easier to review (reviewer can focus solely on code quality since expected outcomes unchanged).\
**Extra setting examples:** They already highlight this heavily. If false, then "refactor" could accidentally introduce features or fixes, which muddies the purpose. True is correct for a strict refactor. The AI will likely double-check by running tests (which it is instructed to do) to confirm behavior is same. If tests fail in a way indicating changed behavior, it'll treat that as an error. This setting is basically to remind the AI at every step to avoid altering logic (like not swapping the order of operations unless it's proven to be equivalent, etc.).

**RUN_TESTS_BEFORE** | TRUE\\
**Interpretation:** Before starting the refactoring changes, the AI will run the test suite (or at least a portion of it) to ensure that everything is passing in the current state. This establishes a baseline that the code functions correctly pre-refactor.\
**Why Useful:** It's important to know you're starting from a green (passing) state. If tests are failing before refactor, then after refactor you might not know if a failure was pre-existing or caused by refactor. Running tests before tells the AI (and user) if there are any lurking issues. If there are, per preempt rules, it might handle them first or abort the refactor. If all tests pass, the AI can proceed confidently, and use that baseline to ensure it doesn't break anything.\
**Extra setting examples:** This is essentially an initial safety check. Many devs do this manually ("don't refactor code that's failing tests -- fix tests first"). They encoded it for the AI. If false, the AI would only find out after making changes, which could complicate debugging. True means any pre-refactor issues are flagged immediately.

**RUN_TESTS_AFTER** | TRUE\\
**Interpretation:** After the refactoring is done, the AI will run the test suite again to ensure that all tests still pass.\
**Why Useful:** This verifies that the refactor did not introduce any functional regressions. If all tests that passed before also pass after, it's strong evidence that behavior is unchanged (assuming good test coverage). It's the key validation step for refactoring integrity.\
**Extra setting examples:** It's basically mandatory for safe refactoring. No one wants to merge a "refactor" that secretly breaks things. If false, the AI might rely on code review or later CI to catch issues, which is not ideal. True ensures immediate feedback, and the AI can fix any issues (or ask user if something weird happened). It pairs with REQUIRE_PASSING_TESTS next.

**REQUIRE_PASSING_TESTS** | TRUE\\
**Interpretation:** As with actions, the refactor is only considered successful if **all tests pass** afterwards. If any fail, that's a problem to address (either by adjusting the refactor or acknowledging a test might be too strict if it, say, asserted on implementation details that changed, then maybe test needs update -- but that's rare if focusing on black-box behavior).\
**Why Useful:** It enforces that "no functional changes" rule quantitatively. A failing test means something changed (or the test was brittle). The AI can't just ignore it -- it must either fix the code to make the test pass or, if the test is wrong, figure that out. But typically in refactor, tests failing indicates a mistake in the refactoring. So this requirement ensures the AI corrects any mistakes before declaring done.\
**Extra setting examples:** Same logic as in action: they want 100% green. If a test was testing something that the refactor reasonably changed (like order of log lines or something non-functional but test expected a certain output), the AI may need to update the test to align with the new equally-correct behavior. That in itself is a functional change though, so hopefully tests are written in a way that avoid that problem. But in any case, this demands a clean outcome.

**IF_FAIL** | ASK_USER\\
**Interpretation:** If the tests (or other validations like lint perhaps) fail after the refactor and the AI can't quickly resolve them, it will ask the user how to proceed. The options are likely similar: roll back, try to fix, proceed anyway, etc. It's essentially the same failure-handling mechanism as after an action.\
**Why Useful:** Refactor ideally shouldn't fail tests if done right, but if it does and the AI is stuck (or fixing it might involve a functional change), user input is needed. Maybe the user accepts a slight change or decides to revert. Asking user prevents the AI from thrashing on an unexpected problem.\
**Extra setting examples:** They don't re-list user answers here, but presumably the same set (ROLLBACK, RESOLVE, PROCEED, ABORT) applies. It's likely implicit that refactor uses the same post-validation dialog if issues arise. It's good to mirror that process for consistency. The user then can confidently use the same commands to control outcome.

**POST_TO_CHAT** | CHANGE_SUMMARY; FILE_CHANGES; RISKS_MITIGATED; VALIDATION_RESULTS; DOCS_UPDATED; EXPECTED_BEHAVIOR\\
**Interpretation:** After refactoring, the AI should post a summary similar to after an action, but tailored to refactoring context:

-   **Change Summary:** Overview of what was refactored (e.g., "Refactored data access layer for better maintainability").

-   **File Changes:** Which files were altered and possibly how (like "combined utils.py and removed duplicate functions in X and Y").

-   **Risks Mitigated:** What problems were addressed by this refactor (e.g., "Removed redundant code to reduce chance of inconsistency, improved security by centralizing auth logic"). Even though refactor is non-functional, it can mitigate risks like future bugs or complexity.

-   **Validation Results:** Confirmation that tests/lint are all passing after refactor. Essentially: "All tests still pass, code quality checks clean."

-   **Docs Updated:** If any documentation or comments were updated as part of the refactor (the config doesn't explicitly mention docs in refactor, but e.g., the AI might update developer docs if code structure changed, or inline comments). If something like architecture docs needed tweaking because structure changed, it would do that.

-   **Expected Behavior:** Should be unchanged, but they might phrase it as "Behavior remains the same as before refactor (verified by tests). The system should function identically but code is now easier to maintain/performance improved etc."\
    **Why Useful:** Even for refactors, giving the user a clear report is important because a lot can happen under the hood. The user sees exactly what was improved and that everything is okay. It also documents the rationale ("risks mitigated" communicates why the refactor was worth doing -- e.g., "reduced app load time by removing duplicate initialization code"). That can justify to stakeholders why time was spent refactoring.\
    **Extra setting examples:** It's nearly the same format as an action summary, adding "Change Summary" vs "Action Summary" and expecting behavior to remain unchanged. This uniformity in reporting style is good for users: every command yields a consistent structured report. They'll come to rely on scanning those sections. It's also helpful for generating changelogs or documentation, since these summaries can be compiled.

[DOCUMENT] -- Documentation Command Configuration
-------------------------------------------------

*This section covers the `/document` command, which the AI uses to generate or update documentation for the project. It details what the AI should document, how, and the process for doing so.*

**BOUND_COMMAND** | DOCUMENT_COMMAND (`/document`)\\
**Interpretation:** The documentation routine is triggered by the `/document` command. When the user enters `/document`, the AI knows to start working on documentation tasks according to the settings here. It's a specialized mode different from normal Q&A or coding.\
**Why Useful:** This clearly separates documentation generation from coding actions. By issuing a command, the user indicates they want the AI to focus on writing docs (be it code comments, user guides, etc.). This also means the AI might use different strategies (like scanning code for missing docs) in this mode. It allows the conversation and outputs to be tailored to documentation, not mixing with coding unless needed.\
**Extra setting examples:** Naming is straightforward. If someone didn't have this, they might attempt to ask the AI "please document the codebase," but the command ensures the AI follows the full procedure laid out in this section. It's consistent with the command-driven interface they've established.

**SCOPE** | FULL\\
**Interpretation:** By default, the documentation command will consider the **entire project** for documentation. That means it can potentially create or update documentation for any part of the codebase that needs it. Not just a single module or the most recent changes, but a holistic documentation pass (unless the user specifically narrows it).\
**Why Useful:** This suggests an intent to ensure all parts of the project are documented. The AI might scan for any undocumented functions, modules, outdated README sections, etc., and address them. Full scope is useful especially if documentation was lagging and you want to bring it up to date in one go. It's like a documentation audit and write combined.\
**Extra setting examples:** Sometimes you might do a partial doc update (like just document a new module). The config here says full, but a user could likely specify partial scope. However, having full as default means the AI is allowed to roam through the whole code looking for documentation opportunities. It aligns with thoroughness.

**FREQUENCY** | UPON_COMMAND\\
**Interpretation:** Documentation generation/updates happen only when the user invokes `/document`. The AI won't spontaneously generate docs after every action (except minimal inline comments as part of code perhaps) without being told. This is an explicit action, likely because generating docs can be time-consuming or verbose, and you want it on demand.\
**Why Useful:** It gives the user control, as always. They might not want detailed documentation at every single change due to overhead or because they're still iterating. When things stabilize, they can run `/document`. It also prevents the AI from cluttering chat or files with docs that weren't asked for yet.\
**Extra setting examples:** They have separate alignment updates for docs after actions, but that presumably is just updating any docs directly impacted by that change. The `/document` command likely goes further, ensuring completeness of all documentation aspects. It's good they don't do that constantly, only on request.

**DOCUMENT_FOR** | SECURITY; PERFORMANCE; MAINTAINABILITY; ACCESSIBILITY; I18N; PRIVACY; CI_CD; DEVEX; BEST_PRACTICES; HUMAN READABILITY; ONBOARDING\\
**Interpretation:** This lists the aspects or perspectives the documentation should cover or be written for:

-   **Security:** There should be documentation about security-related things (e.g., how the system ensures security, how to handle credentials, etc., possibly a security guide or comments about security assumptions).

-   **Performance:** Document performance considerations, maybe complexity of algorithms, how to scale the system, any performance tuning done or needed.

-   **Maintainability:** Possibly internal documentation on code structure, guidelines for contribution, code style docs -- things that help maintain the system.

-   **Accessibility:** Documentation on how the app meets accessibility standards, or guidelines for developers to keep UI accessible. Could be a section in dev docs or user docs if relevant.

-   **I18N (Internationalization):** Document how to add a new language, where translation files are, any special considerations (like date formats) for devs and possibly mention to users if multi-language support exists.

-   **Privacy:** Possibly a privacy policy for users, and dev documentation on data privacy approach (like what data is collected, how to handle personal data, etc.).

-   **CI/CD:** Documentation for the CI/CD pipeline -- how it's set up, how to deploy, etc. Possibly a contributor guide for that or an ops runbook for deployment.

-   **DevEx (Developer Experience):** Documentation aimed at making development easier -- maybe a development setup guide, coding guidelines, etc.

-   **Best Practices:** Documentation of any best practices specific to this project (could overlap with maintainability, but maybe a separate summary of important practices the project follows, like "use environment variables for config" etc.).

-   **Human Readability:** Ensure docs themselves are written in a way a non-technical (or less technical) person can understand where appropriate. Possibly documentation aimed at a general audience or ensuring that even technical docs are clearly explained without too much jargon.

-   **Onboarding:** Guides for new contributors or new team members to get up to speed -- could include an overview of architecture, setup steps (some of which might also fall under devex and maintainability).\
    **Why Useful:** By listing these, they direct the AI to cover all critical areas in documentation. They don't want just an API reference; they want security notes, performance tips, etc. This ensures the documentation isn't one-dimensional. For example, a user guide covers usage, but a security doc covers how data is protected -- both are needed for a complete picture. It's like a doc checklist.\
    **Extra setting examples:** It's almost identical to the audit categories plus some user-facing ones like onboarding and readability. That makes sense: the audit finds issues, and documentation can address many of those categories by explaining them. If any category doesn't apply, the AI can still note "N/A" or minimal info. But likely, they have something to say for each in an ideal world (like at least "We use OWASP best practices" for security doc, etc.).

**DOCUMENTATION_TYPE** | INLINE_CODE_COMMENTS; FUNCTION_DOCS; MODULE_DOCS; ARCHITECTURE_DOCS; API_DOCS; USER_GUIDES; SETUP_GUIDES; MAINTENANCE_GUIDES; CHANGELOG; TODO\\
**Interpretation:** This enumerates the kinds of documentation the AI should produce or maintain:

-   **Inline Code Comments:** Comments within source code explaining logic. The AI might add or ensure these exist for complex code.

-   **Function Docs:** Likely refers to docstrings or documentation for individual functions (parameters, returns, examples of usage).

-   **Module Docs:** Documentation at the top of modules or separate files describing what each module is responsible for, how to use its classes/functions.

-   **Architecture Docs:** High-level documentation of the system's architecture (could be in `/docs/architecture.md` or similar) -- explaining components, data flow, integration points.

-   **API Docs:** Documentation of any APIs (internal or external) the system provides -- endpoints, request/response formats, auth, etc. Could be for REST/GraphQL or even internal interfaces.

-   **User Guides:** How end-users use the application. Possibly if this is a SaaS product, guides for features, or if it's a library, how to integrate it.

-   **Setup Guides:** Installation or deployment guides. They had an install_guide.md, likely the AI will ensure it's up to date or create it if missing.

-   **Maintenance Guides:** Instructions for how to maintain and troubleshoot the system in production (could include things like how to backup, restore, upgrade, monitor).

-   **Changelog:** A file documenting the history of changes, releases, new features, bug fixes over time. The AI could populate or update a CHANGELOG.md with entries for major changes since last version.

-   **TODO:** The to-do list or backlog, ensuring it's documented or updated (they have /ToDo.md and treat it specially, but including it here means the documentation run should also ensure the to-do list is reflective of current state/plans).\
    **Why Useful:** This ensures the AI covers documentation at all levels: from in-code to high-level guides. Each serves different audiences (developers vs. end-users vs. maintainers). They want nothing left undocumented: architecture for understanding the whole system, API for integrators, user guide for customers, etc. By specifying these types, the AI can systematically go through and create/update each one.\
    **Extra setting examples:** It's basically telling the AI to act as a technical writer across every format. Some projects might not include all these (not every project has an external user guide if internal-only, etc.), but listing them means if applicable, do it. They covered basically every doc angle -- even changelog, which is great for release management, and in-code comments to help devs at the micro level. The AI will likely cross reference earlier data (like they had lists of dev docs files, etc.) to know where to put things.

**PREFER_EXISTING_DOCS** | TRUE\\
**Interpretation:** When generating documentation, the AI should prefer to **update or extend existing documentation files**rather than creating new ones from scratch, if those docs exist. For instance, if there's already a `readme.md` or `architecture.md`, it should add to or modify that instead of making a new doc like `architecture2.md`.\
**Why Useful:** It prevents duplication and fragmentation of information. If multiple docs cover the same area, it can confuse readers and becomes harder to maintain. By updating existing docs, they remain the single source of truth for that topic. This also likely means following the style and format of existing docs (so the doc set stays coherent).\
**Extra setting examples:** If false, the AI might scatter information across new docs or duplicate topics. True centralizes updates. If a needed doc is missing entirely, the AI will of course create it. But if something is partially documented, it will build on that. This is a thoughtful approach to doc maintenance -- many times people create new docs because they didn't know an old one existed or it was easier; the AI won't do that mistake.

**DEFAULT_DIRECTORY** | /docs\\
**Interpretation:** If the AI needs to create new documentation files (like architecture docs, user guides, etc.), it should by default place them in the `/docs` directory of the project. That's the designated documentation folder (which aligns with earlier config where /docs holds the dev and install guides).\
**Why Useful:** Keeps documentation organized in one place, which is conventional for many projects. Users or devs know to look in `/docs` for documentation beyond the README. It also separates docs from code, which is tidy. By specifying this, the AI won't scatter docs in random places; it will put them where they belong.\
**Extra setting examples:** If a project used a different structure (like `docs/` at root is common, so that's fine; some might use `doc/` or keep large docs in a wiki or something, but here they keep it in repo). They picked a good default. Possibly they might also update `README.md` at root for brief info and delegate details to /docs files, which is typical.

**NON-COMMENT_DOCUMENTATION_SYNTAX** | MARKDOWN\\
**Interpretation:** Any documentation that isn't in code comments (so, separate files or sections like user guides, architecture docs, etc.) should be written in **Markdown** format. This likely includes things like .md files in /docs or maybe sections of code docstrings if they plan to treat those as markdown (though docstrings might stay plain text or reStructuredText depending on language, but they didn't mention RST, so probably markdown even for docstring style).\
**Why Useful:** Markdown is easy to read and write, and it's the de facto standard for READMEs and many docs (especially on GitHub). By standardizing on Markdown, all docs will have a uniform style and can be easily rendered on GitHub or other tools. It avoids confusion of multiple syntaxes (like not mixing in HTML or reST unnecessarily).\
**Extra setting examples:** Some projects might use reST for Python docstrings if they generate docs with Sphinx, etc. But since this project likely doesn't mention Sphinx, Markdown is fine everywhere. It's simpler and they didn't list a `DOCUMENTATION_TOOL` like Sphinx, so markdown is a good general choice. Good that they clarify "non-comment" because code comments might follow language conventions instead (like `#` in shell scripts or `///` in JS) but that's not a full syntax, just in-line.

**PLAN_BEFORE_DOCUMENT** | TRUE\\
**Interpretation:** The AI will first create a **documentation plan or outline** and present it to the user before actually writing out all the docs. It will likely list which documents it intends to create or update, and a summary of what will go into each, to ensure it matches what the user wants.\
**Why Useful:** Documentation can be very verbose and time-consuming. By planning first, the user can adjust scope or priorities. Maybe the user only cares about certain docs at the moment or wants a particular style. Also, the plan ensures the AI doesn't miss something obvious or do unnecessary work. For example, the plan might say "I will update README, create an Architecture.md, update comments in these modules, etc." and the user can say "Skip the user guide for now" or "Also add an FAQ." This saves effort and leads to more useful docs.\
**Extra setting examples:** If false, the AI might churn out huge docs that the user didn't need or that might contain inaccuracies because of mis-scoping. True fosters collaboration and correctness. It aligns with their approach in actions and refactors -- always plan for big tasks.

**AWAIT_APPROVAL** | TRUE\\
**Interpretation:** After giving the documentation plan, the AI should wait for the user's approval or adjustments before proceeding to actually write or update the documentation.\
**Why Useful:** To ensure the user is on board with what will be documented. Maybe the user only wanted developer docs updated and not user docs at this time; they can clarify. Or they might want to add something to the plan. Approving ensures the AI's potentially very verbose documentation generation is welcome and correctly targeted. It's a courtesy and a precaution (once the AI writes pages of docs, it's a waste if it wasn't what was needed).\
**Extra setting examples:** Again, same pattern as before. It's especially important for docs because writing too much of the wrong thing is not useful. By requiring approval, the user can be like an editor deciding what chapters to include.

**OVERRIDE_APPROVAL_WITH_USER_REQUEST** | TRUE\\
**Interpretation:** If the user's `/document` command clearly indicates they want the docs generated without the planning/approval step (perhaps they said something like "/document full project now, no need for plan"), then the AI can skip straight to creating documentation.\
**Why Useful:** It saves time when the user is confident in what they want. Maybe they did a plan before or trust the AI to just do it. Or they're in a hurry to get docs out. This just respects user command nuance. They have to explicitly or implicitly indicate it; otherwise by default it will always plan and wait.\
**Extra setting examples:** Consistent with others -- gives power users a shortcut. Perhaps if a user is repeatedly updating docs, they might skip planning after the first time. Good to have the option.

**TARGET_READER_EXPERTISE** | NON-TECHNICAL_UNLESS_OTHERWISE_INSTRUCTED\\
**Interpretation:** By default, the documentation (particularly user-facing docs like user guides, but maybe even technical docs) should be written as if addressing a **non-technical audience**, unless the user says to target a more technical audience for specific docs. Essentially, keep language clear and accessible, avoid heavy jargon, and assume the reader might not have deep technical knowledge (especially for user and onboarding docs). For developer-centric docs like code comments or architecture, "non-technical" might mean just to explain things clearly without assuming too much prior context.\
**Why Useful:** It ensures that documentation is broadly understandable. Many users (e.g., product users, or even some stakeholders or new developers) might not be extremely technical. Writing in a simpler way broadens who can benefit from the docs. It also usually leads to better clarity even for technical readers. They can always add advanced sections if needed, but baseline should be approachable.\
**Extra setting examples:** They caveat "unless otherwise instructed", meaning the user can override per doc. Maybe architecture docs can be more technical if they say so. But default is a safe assumption that simpler is better. This is actually quite user-focused, thinking that maybe the audience includes non-devs (like program managers or onboarding newbies). It aligns with making the product accessible to assume non-technical readers for things like how to use the software or understand its high-level workings.

**ENSURE_CURRENT** | TRUE\\
**Interpretation:** The AI must ensure all documentation it produces is **up-to-date** with the current state of the code and product. It shouldn't include outdated info, and if it finds something in docs that's no longer true, it should update it. Essentially, by the end of `/document`, all docs should reflect the current reality.\
**Why Useful:** The whole point is to catch up or maintain documentation. This setting makes it explicit: do not leave known outdated bits lingering. It probably overlaps with scan for outdated docs which was in alignment, but here it's a directive during documentation generation as well. If something changed recently (like config or feature behavior), the docs must reflect that.\
**Extra setting examples:** This is a quality assurance check for the doc process. Without it, the AI might accidentally propagate old info if it drew from an outdated source. But "ensure current" likely means the AI will cross-verify against code and recent changes, maybe run through commit history or use the code as ground truth. It's a tall order but that's what the AI is for.

**ENSURE_CONSISTENT** | TRUE\\
**Interpretation:** The AI should ensure the documentation is **consistent** across all sections. Terminology, formatting, and information should not conflict. If one doc says one thing and another says something else, that needs resolving. If one uses certain terms or units, others should too.\
**Why Useful:** Consistent documentation prevents confusion. It also looks professional. For instance, if the UI labels something "Project" but some docs call it "Application", the AI should unify that. Or if one guide uses British English and another American English, maybe unify (not as critical but consistency is good). It likely means checking that all docs reflect the same decisions and style.\
**Extra setting examples:** We saw alignment had checks for consistency. This likely reiterates that the output of documentation command should be internally consistent as well. Perhaps the AI will review the set of docs as a whole after writing to ensure consistency. Great for quality.

**ENSURE_NO_CONFLICTING_DOCS** | TRUE\\
**Interpretation:** Similar to consistent, but specifically, there should be **no direct contradictions** between different documents. If the AI finds any conflicts in content, it must resolve them (either by choosing one truth and updating the other or merging content).\
**Why Useful:** It's critical that documentation doesn't give opposite instructions or information in two places. That can lead to errors or mistrust in docs. This ensures one voice and one truth. For example, installation guide vs README steps -- they should align. If they conflicted (maybe one says use Docker, another says use pip), the AI must reconcile into a single coherent approach or note context if both possible.\
**Extra setting examples:** It's basically zero tolerance for contradictions. That's ideal in docs -- one reason single-sourcing or linking is good. The AI might reduce conflict by centralizing certain info (like have one configuration table and reference it in multiple docs rather than duplicating). This is an advanced doc management concept but they clearly want a high standard.

* * * * *

All the settings above collectively instruct the AI to operate methodically, transparently, and with high standards for quality and safety at every stage of interacting with code and documentation. It essentially turns the AI into a diligent project contributor that plans carefully, adheres to best practices, seeks confirmations for major changes, and keeps everything (code, tests, docs, tasks) in sync. Following these guidelines, the AI can help maintain a complex project reliably over time, catching problems early and producing outputs (code or docs) that are immediately useful and integrate smoothly into the team's workflow.
